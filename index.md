# Welcome to mia-reader 

mia-reader started as an unofficial mirror of selected works from the [Marxists Internet Archive](https://www.marxists.org/), created with a focus on web and mobile readability. 

mia-reader now includes works from a wider range of sources, curated on a loose whim by the creator for personal use as much as anything else.

## Archives

- [Marx Selected Works](/marxsw/)

### Note: 
The entire archive is not reproduced here, instead, the list of works has been curated from a small subset of the works as a test case. To request a work be added to the list, please [open an issue](https://github.com/victoria-riley-barnett/mia-reader/issues) on the [github repository](https://www.github.com/victoria-riley-barnett/mia-reader). If you've already converted a work to markdown, please consider submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/victoria-riley-barnett/mia-reader/pulls). Technical details can be found in the [contributions guide](/contributing).
