> "At the request of my friend, [Paul
> Lafargue](../../../../../glossary/people/l/a.htm#paul-lafargue), now
> representative of Lille in the French Chamber of Deputies, I arranged
> three chapters of this book as a pamphlet, which he translated and
> published in 1880, under the title: *Socialisme utopique et Socialisme
> scientifique*. From this [French
> text](../../../../../francais/marx/80-utopi/index.htm), a Polish and a
> Spanish edition were prepared. In 1883, our German friends brought out
> the pamphlet in the original language. Italian, Russian, Danish,
> Dutch, and Roumanian translations, based upon the German text, have
> since been published. Thus, the present English edition, this little
> book circulates in 10 languages. I am not aware that any other
> Socialist work, not even our [Communist
> Manifesto](../../1848/communist-manifesto/index.htm) of 1848, or
> Marx\'s [Capital](../../1867-c1/index.htm), has been so often
> translated. In Germany, it has had four editions of about 20,000
> copies in all." \[from the [Preface to the 1892 English
> Edition](int-mat.htm)\]
