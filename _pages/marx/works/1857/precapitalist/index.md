As these were not intended for publication, but rather Marx's
self-clarification, no care was given to the construction of paragraphs.
Rather than leave such interminable paragraphs intact, they have been
broken up.

*Pre-Capitalist Economic Formations* is part of a huge manuscript Marx
wrote in researching and preparing what would become *[A Contribution to
the Critique of Political
Economy](../../1859/critique-pol-economy/index.htm)* published in 1859.

Marx's collection of personal notebooks, of which this text was a part,
would finally be published for public perusal in Russian in Moscow,
1939--41. It was printed in German in 1953 as the *[Grundrisse der
Kritik der Politischen Ökonomie](../../1857/grundrisse/index.htm)* ---
or the *Grundrisse*, or *Outline*, for short.

*Pre-Capitalist Economic Formations* is pp. 471--514 of the
*[Grundrisse](../../1857/grundrisse/ch09.htm#p471)* and was published
separately in Berlin, 1952, as a pamphlet called *Formen die der
Kapitalistischen Produktion vorhergehen*.
