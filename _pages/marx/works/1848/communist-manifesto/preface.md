> The [Communist
> League](../../../../../glossary/orgs/c/o.htm#communist-league), an
> international association of workers, which could of course be only a
> secret one, under conditions obtaining at the time, commissioned us,
> the undersigned, at the Congress held in London in November 1847, to
> write for publication a detailed theoretical and practical programme
> for the Party. Such was the origin of the following Manifesto, the
> manuscript of which travelled to London to be printed a few weeks
> before the February [\[French\]]{.inote} Revolution [\[in
> 1848\]]{.inote}. First published in German, it has been republished in
> that language in at least twelve different editions in Germany,
> England, and America. It was published in English for the first time
> in 1850 in the [Red
> Republican](../../../../../glossary/periodicals/r/e.htm#red-republican),
> London, translated by Miss Helen Macfarlane, and in 1871 in at least
> three different translations in America. The french version first
> appeared in Paris shortly before the [June
> insurrection](../../../../../glossary/events/j/u.htm#june-insurrection-1848)
> of 1848, and recently in [Le
> Socialiste](../../../../../glossary/periodicals/l/e.htm#le-socialiste)
> of New York. A new translation is in the course of preparation. A
> Polish version appeared in London shortly after it was first published
> in Germany. A Russian translation was published in Geneva in the
> sixties ^[\[A\]](#e1){#eb1}^. Into Danish, too, it was translated
> shortly after its appearance.
>
> However much that state of things may have altered during the last
> twenty-five years, the general principles laid down in the Manifesto
> are, on the whole, as correct today as ever. Here and there, some
> detail might be improved. The practical application of the principles
> will depend, as the Manifesto itself states, everywhere and at all
> times, on the historical conditions for the time being existing, and,
> for that reason, no special stress is laid on the revolutionary
> measures proposed at the end of [Section II](ch02.htm). That passage
> would, in many respects, be very differently worded today. In view of
> the gigantic strides of Modern Industry since 1848, and of the
> accompanying improved and extended organization of the working class,
> in view of the practical experience gained, first in the February
> Revolution, and then, still more, in the Paris Commune, where the
> proletariat for the first time held political power for two whole
> months, this programme has in some details been antiquated. One thing
> especially was proved by the Commune, viz., that "the working class
> cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery, and wield it
> for its own purposes." (See [The Civil War in France: Address of the
> General Council of the International Working Men' s
> Association](../../1871/civil-war-france/index.htm), 1871, where this
> point is further developed.) Further, it is self-evident that the
> criticism of socialist literature is deficient in relation to the
> present time, because it comes down only to 1847; also that the
> remarks on the relation of the Communists to the various opposition
> parties ([Section IV](ch04.htm)), although, in principle still
> correct, yet in practice are antiquated, because the political
> situation has been entirely changed, and the progress of history has
> swept from off the earth the greater portion of the political parties
> there enumerated.
>
> But then, the Manifesto has become a historical document which we have
> no longer any right to alter. A subsequent edition may perhaps appear
> with an introduction bridging the gap from 1847 to the present day;
> but this reprint was too unexpected to leave us time for that.

> ## The 1882 Russian Edition
>
> The first Russian edition of the Manifesto of the Communist Party,
> translated by Bakunin ^[\[A\]](#e1){#eb1a}^, was published early in
> the 'sixties by the printing office of the Kolokol [\[reference to the
> [Free Russian Printing
> House](../../../../../glossary/periodicals/f/r.htm#free-russian-printing-house)\]]{.inote}.
> Then the West could see in it (the Russian edition of the Manifesto)
> only a literary curiosity. Such a view would be impossible today.
>
> What a limited field the proletarian movement occupied at that time
> (December 1847) is most clearly shown by the [last section](ch04.htm):
> the position of the Communists in relation to the various opposition
> parties in various countries. Precisely Russia and the United States
> are missing here. It was the time when Russia constituted the last
> great reserve of all European reaction, when the United States
> absorbed the surplus proletarian forces of Europe through immigration.
> Both countries provided Europe with raw materials and were at the same
> time markets for the sale of its industrial products. Both were,
> therefore, in one way of another, pillars of the existing European
> system.
>
> How very different today. Precisely European immigration fitted North
> American for a gigantic agricultural production, whose competition is
> shaking the very foundations of European landed property --- large and
> small. At the same time, it enabled the United States to exploit its
> tremendous industrial resources with an energy and on a scale that
> must shortly break the industrial monopoly of Western Europe, and
> especially of England, existing up to now. Both circumstances react in
> a revolutionary manner upon America itself. Step by step, the small
> and middle land ownership of the farmers, the basis of the whole
> political constitution, is succumbing to the competition of giant
> farms; at the same time, a mass industrial proletariat and a fabulous
> concentration of capital funds are developing for the first time in
> the industrial regions.
>
> And now Russia! During the Revolution of 1848-9, not only the European
> princes, but the European bourgeois as well, found their only
> salvation from the proletariat just beginning to awaken in Russian
> intervention. The Tsar was proclaimed the chief of European reaction.
> Today, he is a prisoner of war of the revolution in Gatchina
> ^[\[B\]](#e2){#eb2}^, and Russia forms the vanguard of revolutionary
> action in Europe.
>
> The Communist Manifesto had, as its object, the proclamation of the
> inevitable impending dissolution of modern bourgeois property. But in
> Russia we find, face-to-face with the rapidly flowering capitalist
> swindle and bourgeois property, just beginning to develop, more than
> half the land owned in common by the peasants. Now the question is:
> can the Russian
> [obshchina](../../../../../glossary/terms/o/b.htm#obshchina), though
> greatly undermined, yet a form of primeval common ownership of land,
> pass directly to the higher form of Communist common ownership? Or, on
> the contrary, must it first pass through the same process of
> dissolution such as constitutes the historical evolution of the West?
>
> The only answer to that possible today is this: If the Russian
> Revolution becomes the signal for a proletarian revolution in the
> West, so that both complement each other, the present Russian common
> ownership of land may serve as the starting point for a communist
> development.

> The preface to the present edition I must, alas, sign alone. Marx, the

> than to any one else --- rests at Highgate Cemetery and over his grave
> the first grass is already growing. Since his death [\[March 14,

> again to state the following expressly:
>
> The basic thought running through the Manifesto --- that economic
> production, and the structure of society of every historical epoch
> necessarily arising therefrom, constitute the foundation for the
> political and intellectual history of that epoch; that consequently
> (ever since the dissolution of the primaeval communal ownership of
> land) all history has been a history of class struggles, of struggles
> between exploited and exploiting, between dominated and dominating
> classes at various stages of social evolution; that this struggle,
> however, has now reached a stage where the exploited and oppressed
> class (the proletariat) can no longer emancipate itself from the class
> which exploits and oppresses it (the bourgeoisie), without at the same
> time forever freeing the whole of society from exploitation,
> oppression, class struggles --- this basic thought belongs solely and
> exclusively to Marx. ^[(1)](#a1){#a1b}^

> I have already stated this many times; but precisely now is it

> ## The 1888 English Edition
>
> The Manifesto was published as the platform of the Communist League, a
> working men' s association, first exclusively German, later on
> international, and under the political conditions of the Continent
> before 1848, unavoidably a secret society. At a Congress of the
> League, held in November 1847, Marx and Engels were commissioned to
> prepare a complete theoretical and practical party programme. Drawn up
> in German, in January 1848, the manuscript was sent to the printer in
> London a few weeks before the French Revolution of February 24. A
> French translation was brought out in Paris shortly before the
> insurrection of June 1848. The first English translation, by Miss
> Helen Macfarlane, appeared in George Julian Harney' s *Red
> Republican*, London, 1850. A Danish and a Polish edition had also been
> published.
>
> The defeat of the Parisian insurrection of June 1848 --- the first
> great battle between proletariat and bourgeoisie --- drove again into
> the background, for a time, the social and political aspirations of
> the European working class. Thenceforth, the struggle for supremacy
> was, again, as it had been before the Revolution of February, solely
> between different sections of the propertied class; the working class
> was reduced to a fight for political elbow-room, and to the position
> of extreme wing of the middle-class Radicals. Wherever independent
> proletarian movements continued to show signs of life, they were
> ruthlessly hunted down. Thus the Prussian police hunted out the
> Central Board of the Communist League, then located in Cologne. The
> members were arrested and, after eighteen months' imprisonment, they
> were tried in October 1852. This celebrated "[Cologne Communist
> Trial](../../../../../glossary/events/c/o.htm#cologne-communist-trial)"
> lasted from October 4 till November 12; seven of the prisoners were
> sentenced to terms of imprisonment in a fortress, varying from three
> to six years. Immediately after the sentence, the League was formally
> dissolved by the remaining members. As to the Manifesto, it seemed
> henceforth doomed to oblivion.
>
> When the European workers had recovered sufficient strength for
> another attack on the ruling classes, the [International Working Men'
> s Association](../../../../../glossary/orgs/i/n.htm#iwma) sprang up.
> But this association, formed with the express aim of welding into one
> body the whole militant proletariat of Europe and America, could not
> at once proclaim the principles laid down in the Manifesto. The
> International was bound to have a programme broad enough to be
> acceptable to the English trade unions, to the followers of
> [Proudhon](../../../../../glossary/people/p/r.htm#proudhon) in France,
> Belgium, Italy, and Spain, and to the
> [Lassalleans](../../../../../glossary/terms/l/a.htm#lassalleans) in
> Germany. ^[(2)](#a2){#a2b}^
>
> Marx, who drew up this programme to the satisfaction of all parties,
> entirely trusted to the intellectual development of the working class,
> which was sure to result from combined action and mutual discussion.
> The very events and vicissitudes in the struggle against capital, the
> defeats even more than the victories, could not help bringing home to
> men' s minds the insufficiency of their various favorite nostrums, and
> preparing the way for a more complete insight into the true conditions
> for working-class emancipation. And Marx was right. The International,
> on its breaking in 1874, left the workers quite different men from
> what it found them in 1864. Proudhonism in France, Lassalleanism in
> Germany, were dying out, and even the conservative English trade
> unions, though most of them had long since severed their connection
> with the International, were gradually advancing towards that point at
> which, last year at Swansea, their president [\[W. Bevan\]]{.inote}
> could say in their name: "Continental socialism has lost its terror
> for us." In fact, the principles of the Manifesto had made
> considerable headway among the working men of all countries.
>
> The Manifesto itself came thus to the front again. Since 1850, the
> German text had been reprinted several times in Switzerland, England,
> and America. In 1872, it was translated into English in New York,
> where the translation was published in *Woodhull and Claflin' s
> Weekly*. From this English version, a French one was made in *Le
> Socialiste* of New York. Since then, at least two more English
> translations, more or less mutilated, have been brought out in
> America, and one of them has been reprinted in England. The first
> Russian translation, made by Bakunin, was published at Herzen' s
> Kolokol office in Geneva, about 1863; a second one, by the heroic Vera
> Zasulich, also in Geneva, in 1882. A new Danish edition is to be found
> in *Socialdemokratisk Bibliothek*, Copenhagen, 1885; a fresh French
> translation in *Le Socialiste*, Paris, 1886. From this latter, a
> Spanish version was prepared and published in Madrid, 1886. The German
> reprints are not to be counted; there have been twelve altogether at
> the least. An Armenian translation, which was to be published in
> Constantinople some months ago, did not see the light, I am told,
> because the publisher was afraid of bringing out a book with the name
> of Marx on it, while the translator declined to call it his own
> production. Of further translations into other languages I have heard
> but had not seen. Thus the history of the Manifesto reflects the
> history of the modern working-class movement; at present, it is
> doubtless the most wide spread, the most international production of
> all socialist literature, the common platform acknowledged by millions
> of working men from Siberia to California.
>
> Yet, when it was written, we could not have called it a *socialist*
> manifesto. By Socialists, in 1847, were understood, on the one hand
> the adherents of the various Utopian systems: Owenites in England,
> Fourierists in France, [\[See [Robert
> Owen](../../../../../glossary/people/o/w.htm#owen) and [François
> Fourier](../../../../../glossary/people/f/o.htm#fourier)\]]{.inote}
> both of them already reduced to the position of mere sects, and
> gradually dying out; on the other hand, the most multifarious social
> quacks who, by all manner of tinkering, professed to redress, without
> any danger to capital and profit, all sorts of social grievances, in
> both cases men outside the working-class movement, and looking rather
> to the "educated\" classes for support. Whatever portion of the
> working class had become convinced of the insufficiency of mere
> political revolutions, and had proclaimed the necessity of total
> social change, called itself Communist. It was a crude, rough-hewn,
> purely instinctive sort of communism; still, it touched the cardinal
> point and was powerful enough amongst the working class to produce the
> Utopian communism of Cabet in France, and of Weitling in Germany.
> Thus, in 1847, socialism was a middle-class movement, communism a
> working-class movement. Socialism was, on the Continent at least,
> "respectable"; communism was the very opposite. And as our notion,
> from the very beginning, was that "the emancipation of the workers
> must be the act of the working class itself," there could be no doubt
> as to which of the two names we must take. Moreover, we have, ever
> since, been far from repudiating it.
>
> The Manifesto being our joint production, I consider myself bound to
> state that the fundamental proposition which forms the nucleus belongs
> to Marx. That proposition is: That in every historical epoch, the
> prevailing mode of economic production and exchange, and the social
> organization necessarily following from it, form the basis upon which
> is built up, and from which alone can be explained the political and
> intellectual history of that epoch; that consequently the whole
> history of mankind (since the dissolution of primitive tribal society,
> holding land in common ownership) has been a history of class
> struggles, contests between exploiting and exploited, ruling and
> oppressed classes; That the history of these class struggles forms a
> series of evolutions in which, nowadays, a stage has been reached
> where the exploited and oppressed class --- the proletariat --- cannot
> attain its emancipation from the sway of the exploiting and ruling
> class --- the bourgeoisie --- without, at the same time, and once and
> for all, emancipating society at large from all exploitation,
> oppression, class distinction, and class struggles.
>
> This proposition, which, in my opinion, is destined to do for history
> what Darwin' s theory has done for biology, we both of us, had been
> gradually approaching for some years before 1845. How far I had
> independently progressed towards it is best shown by my [Conditions of

> England](../../1845/condition-working-class/index.htm). But when I
> again met Marx at Brussels, in spring 1845, he had it already worked

>
> A new French version appeared in 1886, in *Le Socialiste* of Paris; it

>
> From this latter, a Spanish version was published the same year in *El

> Administracion de El Socialista, Hernan Cortes 8.
>
> As a matter of curiosity, I may mention that in 1887 the manuscript of
> an Armenian translation was offered to a publisher in Constantinople.
> But the good man did not have the courage to publish something bearing
> the name of Marx and suggested that the translator set down his own
> name as author, which the latter however declined.
>
> After one, and then another, of the more or less inaccurate American
> translations had been repeatedly reprinted in England, an authentic
> version at last appeared in 1888. This was my friend Samuel Moore, and
> we went through it together once more before it went to press. It is

> Frederick Engels. Authorized English translation, edited and annotated
> by Frederick Engels, 1888, London, William Reeves, 185 Fleet Street,
> E.C. I have added some of the notes of that edition to the present
> one.
>
> The Manifesto has had a history of its own. Greeted with enthusiasm,
> at the time of its appearance, by the not at all numerous vanguard of
> scientific socialism (as is proved by the translations mentioned in
> the first place), it was soon forced into the background by the

> and was finally excommunicated "by law" in the conviction of the
> Cologne Communists in November 1852. With the disappearance from the
> public scene of the workers' movement that had begun with the February
> Revolution, the Manifesto too passed into the background.
>
> When the European workers had again gathered sufficient strength for a
> new onslaught upon the power of the ruling classes, the International
> Working Men' s Association came into being. Its aim was to weld
> together into *one* huge army the whole militant working class of
> Europe and America. Therefore it could not *set out* from the

> programme which would not shut the door on the English trade unions,
> the French, Belgian, Italian, and Spanish Proudhonists, and the German
> Lassalleans. This programme --- the considerations underlying the
> Statutes of the International --- was drawn up by Marx with a master
> hand acknowledged even by the Bakunin and the anarchists. For the
> ultimate final triumph of the ideas set forth in the Manifesto, Marx
> relied solely upon the intellectual development of the working class,
> as it necessarily has to ensue from united action and discussion. The

> even more than the successes, could not but demonstrate to the
> fighters the inadequacy of their former universal panaceas, and make
> their minds more receptive to a thorough understanding of the true
> conditions for working-class emancipation. And Marx was right. The
> working class of 1874, at the dissolution of the International, was
> altogether different from that of 1864, at its foundation. Proudhonism
> in the Latin countries, and the specific Lassalleanism in Germany,
> were dying out; and even the ten arch-conservative English trade
> unions were gradually approaching the point where, in 1887, the
> chairman of their Swansea Congress could say in their name:
> "Continental socialism has lost its terror for us." Yet by 1887
> continental socialism was almost exclusively the theory heralded in
> the Manifesto. Thus, to a certain extent, the history of the Manifesto
> reflects the history of the modern working-class movement since 1848.
> At present, it is doubtless the most widely circulated, the most
> international product of all socialist literature, the common
> programme of many millions of workers of all countries from Siberia to
> California.
>
> Nevertheless, when it appeared, we could not have called it a
> *socialist* manifesto. In 1847, two kinds of people were considered
> socialists. On the one hand were the adherents of the various utopian

> Publication of the Manifesto of the Communist Party coincided, one may
> say, with March 18, 1848, the day of the revolution in Milan and
> Berlin, which were armed uprisings of the two nations situated in the
> centre, the one, of the continent of Europe, the other, of the
> Mediterranean; two nations until then enfeebled by division and
> internal strife, and thus fallen under foreign domination. While Italy
> was subject to the Emperor of Austria, Germany underwent the yoke, not
> less effective though more indirect, of the Tsar of all the Russias.
> The consequences of March 18, 1848, freed both Italy and Germany from
> this disgrace; if from 1848 to 1871 these two great nations were
> reconstituted and somehow again put on their own, it was as Karl Marx
> used to say, because the men who suppressed the Revolution of 1848
> were, nevertheless, its testamentary executors in spite of themselves.

> Everywhere that revolution was the work of the working class; it was
> the latter that built the barricades and paid with its lifeblood. Only
> the Paris workers, in overthrowing the government, had the very
> definite intention of overthrowing the bourgeois regime. But conscious
> though they were of the fatal antagonism existing between their own
> class and the bourgeoisie, still, neither the economic progress of the
> country nor the intellectual development of the mass of French workers
> had as yet reached the stage which would have made a social
> reconstruction possible. In the final analysis, therefore, the fruits
> of the revolution were reaped by the capitalist class. In the other
> countries, in Italy, in Germany, in Austria, the workers, from the
> very outset, did nothing but raise the bourgeoisie to power. But in
> any country the rule of the bourgeoisie is impossible without national
> independence Therefore, the Revolution of 1848 had to bring in its
> train the unity and autonomy of the nations that had lacked them up to
> then: Italy, Germany, Hungary. Poland will follow in turn.

> Thus, if the Revolution of 1848 was not a socialist revolution, it
> paved the way, prepared the ground for the latter. Through the impetus
> given to large-scaled industry in all countries, the bourgeois regime
> during the last forty-five years has everywhere created a numerous,
> concentrated and powerful proletariat. It has thus raised, to use the
> language of the Manifesto, its own grave-diggers. Without restoring
> autonomy and unity to each nation, it will be impossible to achieve

> intelligent co-operation of these nations toward common aims. Just
