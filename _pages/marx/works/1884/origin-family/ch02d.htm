Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State
</p>
<h1>II. The Family</h1>
<h3>4. The Monogamous Family</h3>
<BR>

<P class="fst">It develops out of the pairing family, as previously shown, in the
transitional period between the upper and middle stages of barbarism;
its decisive victory is one of the signs that civilization is
beginning.  It is based on the supremacy of the man, the express
purpose being to produce children of undisputed paternity; such
paternity is demanded because these children are later to come into
their father&#8217;s property as his natural heirs.  It is distinguished from
pairing marriage by the much greater strength of the marriage tie,
which can no longer be dissolved at either partner&#8217;s wish.  As a rule,
it is now only the man who can dissolve it, and put away his wife.  The
right of conjugal infidelity also remains secured to him, at any rate
by custom (the <i>Code Napoléon</i> explicitly accords it to the husband as
long as he does not bring his concubine into the house), and as social
life develops he exercises his right more and more; should the wife
recall the old form of sexual life and attempt to revive it, she is
punished more severely than ever.
</P>

<P>
We meet this new form of the family in all its severity among the
Greeks.  While the position of the goddesses in their mythology, as
Marx points out, brings before us an earlier period when the position
of women was freer and more respected, in the heroic age we find the
woman already being humiliated by the domination of the man and by
competition from girl slaves.  Note how Telemachus in the <i>Odyssey</i>
silences his mother. <span class="inote">[The reference is to a passage where Telemachus,
son of Odysseus and Penelope, tells his mother to get on with her
weaving and leave the men to mind their own business &#8211; Ed.]</span>  In Homer
young women are booty and are handed over to the pleasure of the
conquerors, the handsomest being picked by the commanders in order of
rank; the entire <i>Iliad</i>, it will be remembered, turns on the quarrel of
Achilles and Agamemnon over one of these slaves.  If a hero is of any
importance, Homer also mentions the captive girl with whom he shares
his tent and his bed.  These girls were also taken back to Greece and
brought under the same roof as the wife, as Cassandra was brought by
Agamemnon in AEschylus; the sons  begotten of them received a small
share of the paternal inheritance and had the full status of freemen. 
Teucer, for instance, is a natural son of Telamon by one of these
slaves and has the right to use his father&#8217;s name.  The legitimate wife
was expected to put up with all this, but herself to remain strictly
chaste and faithful.  In the heroic age a Greek woman is, indeed, more
respected than in the period of civilization, but to her husband she is
after all nothing but the mother of his legitimate children and heirs,
his chief housekeeper and the supervisor of his female slaves, whom he
can and does take as concubines if he so fancies.  It is the existence
of slavery side by side with monogamy, the presence of young, beautiful
slaves belonging unreservedly to the <i>man</i>, that stamps monogamy from the
very beginning with its specific character of monogamy <i>for the woman
only</i>, but not for the man.  And that is the character it still has
today. 
</P>

<P>
Coming to the later Greeks, we must distinguish between Dorians and
Ionians.  Among the former &#8211; Sparta is the classic example &#8211; marriage
relations are in some ways still more archaic than even in Homer.  The
recognized form of marriage in Sparta was a pairing marriage, modified
according to the Spartan conceptions of the state, in which there still
survived vestiges of group marriage.  Childless marriages were
dissolved; King Anaxandridas (about 650 B.C.), whose first wife was
childless, took a second and kept two households; about the same time,
King Ariston, who had two unfruitful wives, took a third, but dismissed
one of the other two.  On the other hand, several brothers could have a
wife in common; a friend who preferred his friend&#8217;s wife could share
her with him; and it was considered quite proper to place one&#8217;s wife at
the disposal of a sturdy &#8220;stallion,&#8221; as Bismarck would say, even if he
was not a citizen.  A passage in Plutarch, where a Spartan woman refers
an importunate wooer to her husband, seems to indicate, according to
Schamann, even greater freedom.  Real adultery, secret infidelity by
the woman without the husband&#8217;s knowledge, was therefore unheard of. 
On the other hand, domestic slavery was unknown in Sparta, at least
during its best period; the unfree helots were segregated on the
estates and the Spartans were therefore less tempted to take the
helots&#8217; wives.  Inevitably in these conditions women held a much more
honored position in Sparta than anywhere else in Greece.  The Spartan
women and the elite of the Athenian <i>hetairai</i> are the only Greek women
of whom the ancients speak with respect and whose words they thought it
worth while to record. 
</P>

<P>
The position is quite different among the Ionians; here Athens is
typical.  Girls only learned spinning, weaving, and sewing, and at most
a little reading and writing.  They lived more or less behind locked
doors and had no company except other women.  The women&#8217;s apartments
formed a separate part of the house, on the upper floor or at the back,
where men, especially strangers, could not easily enter, and to which
the women retired when men visited the house.  They never went out
without being accompanied by a female slave; indoors they were kept
under regular guard.  Aristophanes speaks of Molossian dogs kept to
frighten away adulterers, and, at any rate in the Asiatic towns,
eunuchs were employed to keep watch over the women-making and exporting
eunuchs was an industry in Chios as early as Herodotus&#8217; time, and,
according to Wachsmuth, it was not only the barbarians who bought the
supply.  In Euripides a woman is called an <i>oikourema</i>, a thing (the word
is neuter) for looking after the house, and, apart from her business of
bearing children, that was all she was for the Athenian &#8211; his chief
female domestic servant.  The man had his athletics and his public
business, from which women were barred; in addition, he often had
female slaves at his disposal and during the most flourishing days of
Athens an extensive system of prostitution which the state at least
favored.  It was precisely through this system of prostitution that the
only Greek women of personality were able to develop, and to acquire
that intellectual and artistic culture by which they stand out as high
above the general level of classical womanhood as the Spartan women by
their qualities of character.  But that a woman had to be a <i>hetaira</i>
before she could be a woman is the worst condemnation of the Athenian
family.
</P>

<P>
This Athenian family became in time the accepted model for domestic
relations, not only among the Ionians, but to an increasing extent
among all the Greeks of the mainland and colonies also.  But, in spite
of locks and guards, Greek women found plenty of opportunity for
deceiving their husbands.  The men, who would have been ashamed to show
any love for their wives, amused themselves by all sorts of love
affairs with <i>hetairai</i>; but this degradation of the women was avenged on
the men and degraded them also, till they fell into the abominable
practice of pederasty [<i>Knabenliebe</i>]<sup class="enote"><a href="#isj">[1]</a></sup> and degraded alike their gods and themselves with
the myth of Ganymede.
</P>

<P>
This is the origin of monogamy as far as we can trace it back among the
most civilized and highly developed people of antiquity.  It was not in
any way the fruit of individual sex-love, with which it had nothing
whatever to do; marriages remained as before marriages of convenience. 
It was the first form of the family to be based, not on natural, but on
economic conditions &#8211; on the victory of private property over
primitive, natural communal property.  The Greeks themselves put the
matter quite frankly: the sole exclusive aims of monogamous marriage
were to make the man supreme in the family, and to propagate, as the
future heirs to his wealth, children indisputably his own.  Otherwise,
marriage was a burden, a duty which had to be performed, whether one
liked it or not, to gods, state, and one&#8217;s ancestors.  In Athens the
law exacted from the man not only marriage but also the performance of
a minimum of so-called conjugal duties.
</P>

<P>
Thus when monogamous marriage first makes its appearance in history, it
is not as the reconciliation of man and woman, still less as the
highest form of such a reconciliation.  Quite the contrary.  Monogamous
marriage comes on the scene as the subjugation of the one sex by the
other; it announces a struggle between the sexes unknown throughout the
whole previous prehistoric period.  In an old unpublished manuscript,
written by Marx and myself in 1846, <span class="inote">[The reference here is to the
<a href="../../1845/german-ideology/index.htm">German Ideology</a>, published after Engels&#8217; death &#8211; Ed.]</span> I find the
words: &#8220;The first division of labor is that between man and woman for
the propagation of children.&#8221; And today I can add: The first class
opposition that appears in history coincides with the development of
the antagonism between man and woman in monogamous marriage, and the
first class oppression coincides with that of the female sex by the
male.  Monogamous marriage was a great historical step forward;
nevertheless, together with slavery and private wealth, it opens the
period that has lasted until today in which every step forward is also
relatively a step backward, in which prosperity and development for
some is won through the misery and frustration of others.  It is the
cellular form of civilized society, in which the nature of the
oppositions and contradictions fully active in that society can be
already studied.
</P>

<P>
The old comparative freedom of sexual intercourse by no means
disappeared with the victory of pairing marriage or even of monogamous
marriage:
</P>

<P class="quote">
     The old conjugal system, now reduced to narrower limits by the
     gradual disappearance of the punaluan groups, still environed the
     advancing family, which it was to follow to the verge of
     civilization ...  It finally disappeared in the new form of
     hetaerism, which still follows mankind in civilization as a dark
     shadow upon the family. 
     </P>
     <P class="inline">
     [Morgan, op. cit., p. 511 &#8211; Ed.]
</P>

<P>
By &#8220;hetaerism&#8221; Morgan understands the practice, <i>co-existent with
monogamous marriage</i>, of sexual intercourse between men and unmarried
women outside marriage, which, as we know, flourishes in the most
varied forms throughout the whole period of civilization and develops
more and more into open prostitution.  This hetaerism derives quite
directly from group marriage, from the ceremonial surrender by which
women purchased the right of chastity.  Surrender for money was at
first a religious act; it took place in the temple of the goddess of
love, and the money originally went into the temple treasury.  The
temple slaves of Anaitis in Armenia and of Aphrodite in Corinth, like
the sacred dancing-girls attached to the temples of India, the
so-called bayaderes (the word is a corruption of the Portuguese word
<i>bailadeira</i>, meaning female dancer), were the first prostitutes. 
Originally the duty of every woman, this surrender was later performed
by these priestesses alone as representatives of all other women. 
Among other peoples, hetaerism derives from the sexual freedom allowed
to girls before marriage &#8211; again, therefore, a relic of group
marriage, but handed down in a different way.  With the rise of the
inequality of property &#8211; already at the upper stage of barbarism,
therefore &#8211; wage-labor appears sporadically side by side with slave
labor, and at the same time, as its necessary correlate, the
professional prostitution of free women side by side with the forced
surrender of the slave.  Thus the heritage which group marriage has
bequeathed to civilization is double-edged, just as everything
civilization brings forth is double-edged, double-tongued, divided
against itself, contradictory: here monogamy, there hetaerism, with its
most extreme form, prostitution.  For hetaerism is as much a social
institution as any other; it continues the old sexual freedom &#8211; to the
advantage of the men.  Actually not merely tolerated, but gaily
practiced, by the ruling classes particularly, it is condemned in
words.  But in reality this condemnation never falls on the men
concerned, but only on the women; they are despised and outcast, in
order that the unconditional supremacy of men over the female sex may
be once more proclaimed as a fundamental law of society.
</P>

<P>
But a second contradiction thus develops within monogamous marriage
itself.  At the side of the husband who embellishes his existence with
hetaerism stands the neglected wife.  And one cannot have one side of
this contradiction without the other, any more than a man has a whole
apple in his hand after eating half.  But that seems to have been the
husbands&#8217; notion, until their wives taught them better.  With
monogamous marriage, two constant social types, unknown hitherto, make
their appearance on the scene &#8211; the wife&#8217;s attendant lover and the
cuckold husband.  The husbands had won the victory over the wives, but
the vanquished magnanimously provided the crown.  Together with
monogamous marriage and hetaerism, adultery became an unavoidable
social institution &#8211; denounced, severely penalized, but impossible to
suppress.  At best, the certain paternity of the children rested on
moral conviction as before, and to solve the insoluble contradiction
the <i>Code Napoléon</i>, Art- 312, decreed: &#8220;<i>L&#8217;enfant conçu pendant le
marriage a pour père le mari</i>,&#8221; the father of a child conceived during
marriage is-the husband.  Such is the final result of three thousand
years of monogamous marriage.
</P>

<P>
Thus, wherever the monogamous family remains true to its historical
origin and clearly reveals the antagonism between the man and the woman
expressed in the man&#8217;s exclusive supremacy, it exhibits in miniature
the same oppositions and contradictions as those in which society has
been moving, without power to resolve or overcome them, ever since it
split into classes at the beginning of civilization.  I am speaking
here, of course, only of those cases of monogamous marriage where
matrimonial life actually proceeds according to the original character
of the whole institution, but where the wife rebels against the
husband&#8217;s supremacy.  Not all marriages turn out thus, as nobody knows
better than the German philistine, who can no more assert his rule in
the home than he can in the state, and whose wife, with every right,
wears the trousers he is unworthy of.  But, to make up for it, he
considers himself far above his French companion in misfortune, to
whom, oftener than to him, something much worse happens.
</P>

<P>
However, monogamous marriage did not by any means appear always and
everywhere in the classically harsh form it took among the Greeks. 
Among the Romans, who, as future world-conquerors, had a larger, if a
less fine, vision than the Greeks, women were freer and more respected.
A Roman considered that his power of life and death over his wife
sufficiently guaranteed her conjugal fidelity.  Here, moreover, the
wife equally with the husband could dissolve the marriage at will.  But
the greatest progress in the development of individual marriage
certainly came with the entry of the Germans into history, and for the
reason that the German &#8211; on account of their poverty, very probably &#8211;
were still at a stage where monogamy seems not yet to have become
perfectly distinct from pairing marriage.  We infer this from three
facts mentioned by Tacitus.  First, though marriage was held in great
reverence &#8211; &#8220;they content themselves with one wife, the women live
hedged round with chastity&#8217;&#8221; &#8211; polygamy was the rule for the
distinguished members and the leaders of the tribe, a condition of
things similar to that among the Americans, where pairing marriage was
the rule.  Secondly, the transition from mother-right to father-right
could only have been made a short time previously, for the brother on
the mother&#8217;s side -the nearest gentile male relation according to
mother-right &#8211;was still considered almost closer of kin than the
father, corresponding again to the standpoint of the American Indians,
among whom Marx, as he often said, found the key to the understanding
of our own primitive age.  And, thirdly, women were greatly respected
among the Germans, and also influential in public affairs, which is in
direct contradiction to the supremacy of men in monogamy.  In almost
all these points the Germans agree with the Spartans, among whom also,
as we saw, pairing marriage had not yet been completely overcome. 
Thus, here again an entirely new influence came to power in the world
with the Germans.  The new monogamy, which now developed from the
mingling of peoples amid the ruins of the Roman world, clothed the
supremacy of the men in milder forms and gave women a position which,
outwardly at any rate, was much more free and respected than it had
ever been in classical antiquity.  Only now were the conditions
realized in which through monogamy-within it, parallel to it, or in
opposition to it, as the case might be-the greatest moral advance we
owe to it could be achieved: modern individual sex-love, which had
hitherto been unknown to the entire world.
</P>

<P>
This advance, however, undoubtedly sprang from the fact that the
Germans still lived in pairing families and grafted the corresponding
position of women onto the monogamous system, so far as that was
possible.  It most decidedly did not spring from the legendary virtue
and wonderful moral purity of the German character, which was nothing
more than the freedom of the pairing family from the crying moral
contradictions of monogamy.  On the contrary, in the course of their
migrations the Germans had morally much deteriorated, particularly
during their southeasterly wanderings among the nomads of the Black Sea
steppes, from whom they acquired, not only equestrian skill, but also
gross, unnatural vices, as Ammianus expressly states of the Taifalians
and Procopius of the Herulians<a name="art3">.</a>
</P>

<P>
But if monogamy was the only one of all the known forms of the family
through which modern sex-love could develop, that does not mean that
within monogamy modern sexual love developed exclusively or even
chiefly as the love of husband and wife for each other.  That was
precluded by the very nature of strictly monogamous marriage under the
rule of the man.  Among all historically active classes &#8211; that is, among
all ruling classes &#8211; matrimony remained what it had been since the
pairing marriage, a matter of convenience which was arranged by the
parents.  The first historical form of sexual love as passion, a
passion recognized as natural to all human beings (at least if they
belonged to the ruling classes), and as the highest form of the sexual
impulse &#8211; and that is what constitutes its specific character &#8211; this first
form of individual sexual love, the chivalrous love of the middle ages,
was by no means conjugal.  Quite the contrary.  In its classic form
among the Provençals, it heads straight for adultery, and the poets of
love celebrated adultery.  The flower of Provençal love poetry are the
Albas (aubades, songs of dawn).  They describe in glowing colors how
the knight lies in bed beside his love-the wife of another man-while
outside stands the watchman who calls to him as soon as the first gray
of dawn (<i>alba</i>) appears, so that he can get away unobserved; the parting
scene then forms the climax of the poem.  The northern French and also
the worthy Germans adopted this kind of poetry together with the
corresponding fashion of chivalrous love; old Wolfram of Eschenbach has
left us three wonderfully beautiful songs of dawn on this same improper
subject, which I like better than his three long heroic poems.
</P>

<P>
Nowadays there are two ways of concluding a bourgeois marriage.  In
Catholic countries the parents, as before, procure a suitable wife for
their young bourgeois son, and the consequence is, of course, the
fullest development of the contradiction inherent in monogamy: the
husband abandons himself to hetaerism and the wife to adultery. 
Probably the only reason why the Catholic Church abolished divorce was
because it had convinced itself that there is no more a cure for
adultery than there is for death.  In Protestant countries, on the
other hand, the rule is that the son of a bourgeois family is allowed
to choose a wife from his own class with more or less freedom; hence
there may be a certain element of love in the marriage, as, indeed, in
accordance with Protestant hypocrisy, is always assumed, for decency&#8217;s
sake.  Here the husband&#8217;s hetaerism is a more sleepy kind of business,
and adultery by the wife is less the rule.  But since, in every kind of
marriage, people remain what they were before, and since the bourgeois
of Protestant countries are mostly philistines, all that this
Protestant monogamy achieves, taking the average of the best cases, is
a conjugal partnership of leaden boredom, known as &#8220;domestic bliss."
The best mirror of these two methods of marrying is the novel-the
French novel for the Catholic manner, the German for the Protestant. 
In both, the hero &#8220;gets&#8221; them: in the German, the young man gets the
girl; in the French, the husband gets the horns.  Which of them is
worse off is sometimes questionable.  This is why the French bourgeois
is as much horrified by the dullness of the German novel as the German
philistine is by the &#8220;immorality&#8221; of the French.  However, now that
 &#8220;Berlin is a world capital,&#8221; the German novel is beginning with a
little less timidity to use as part of its regular stock-in-trade the
hetaerism and adultery long familiar to that town.
</P>

<P>
In both cases, however, the marriage is conditioned by the class
position of the parties and is to that extent always a marriage of
convenience.  In both cases this marriage of convenience turns often
enough into crassest prostitution-sometimes of both partners, but far
more commonly of the woman, who only differs from the ordinary
courtesan in that she does not let out her body on piece-work as a
wage-worker, but sells it once and for all into slavery.  And of all
marriages of convenience Fourier&#8217;s words hold true: &#8220;As in grammar two
negatives make an affirmative, so in matrimonial morality two
prostitutions pass for a virtue.&#8221; [Charles Fourier, Theorie de l&#8217;Uniti
Universelle.  Paris, 1841-45, Vol. III, p. 120. &#8211; Ed.] Sex-love in the
relationship with a woman becomes, and can only become, the real rule
among the oppressed classes, which means today among the
proletariat-whether this relation is officially sanctioned or not.  But
here all the foundations of typical monogamy are cleared away.  Here
there is no property, for the preservation and inheritance of which
monogamy and male supremacy were established; hence there is no
incentive to make this male supremacy effective.  What is more, there
are no means of making it so.  Bourgeois law, which protects this
supremacy, exists only for the possessing class and their dealings with
the proletarians.  The law costs money and, on account of the worker&#8217;s
poverty, it has no validity for his relation to his wife.  Here quite
other personal and social conditions decide.  And now that large-scale
industry has taken the wife out of the home onto the labor market and
into the factory, and made her often the bread-winner of the family, no
basis for any kind of male supremacy is left in the proletarian
household &#8211; except, perhaps, for something of the brutality towards
women that has spread since the introduction of monogamy.  The
proletarian family is therefore no longer monogamous in the strict
sense, even where there is passionate love and firmest loyalty on both
sides, and maybe all the blessings of religious and civil authority. 
Here, therefore, the eternal attendants of monogamy, hetaerism and
adultery, play only an almost vanishing part.  The wife has in fact
regained the right to dissolve the marriage, and if two people cannot
get on with one another, they prefer to separate.  In short,
proletarian marriage is monogamous in the etymological sense of the
word, but not at all in its historical sense.
</P>

<P>
Our jurists, of course, find that progress in legislation is leaving
women with no further ground of complaint.  Modern civilized systems of
law increasingly acknowledge, first, that for a marriage to be legal,
it must be a contract freely entered into by both partners, and,
secondly, that also in the married state both partners must stand on a
common footing of equal rights and duties.  If both these demands are
consistently carried out, say the jurists, women have all they can ask.
</P>

<P>
This typically legalist method of argument is exactly the same as that
which the radical republican bourgeois uses to put the proletarian in
his place.  The labor contract is to be freely entered into by both
partners.  But it is considered to have been freely entered into as
soon as the law makes both parties equal on <i>paper</i>.  The power conferred
on the one party by the difference of class position, the pressure
thereby brought to bear on the other party &#8211; the real economic
position of both &#8211; that is not the law&#8217;s business.  Again, for the
duration of the labor contract both parties are to have equal rights,
in so far as one or the other does not expressly surrender them.  That
economic relations compel the worker to surrender even the last
semblance of equal rights &#8211; here again, that is no concern of the law.
</P>

<P>
In regard to marriage, the law, even the most advanced, is fully
satisfied as soon as the partners have formally recorded that they are
entering into the marriage of their own free consent.  What goes on in
real life behind the juridical scenes, how this free consent comes
about &#8211; that is not the business of the law and the jurist.  And yet
the most  elementary comparative jurisprudence should show the jurist
what this free consent really amounts to.  In the countries where an
obligatory share of the paternal inheritance is secured to the children
by law and they cannot therefore be disinherited &#8211; in Germany, in the
countries with French law and elsewhere &#8211; the children are obliged to
obtain their parents&#8217; consent to their marriage.  In the countries with
English law, where parental consent to a marriage is not legally
required, the parents on their side have full freedom in the
testamentary disposal of their property and can disinherit their
children at their pleasure.  It is obvious that, in spite and precisely
because of this fact, freedom of marriage among the classes with
something to inherit is in reality not a whit greater in England and
America than it is in France and Germany.
</P>

<P>
As regards the legal equality of husband and wife in marriage, the
position is no better.  The legal inequality of the two partners,
bequeathed to us from earlier social conditions, is not the cause but
the effect of the economic oppression of the woman.  In the old
communistic household, which comprised many couples and their children,
the task entrusted to the women of managing the household was as much a
public and socially necessary industry as the procuring of food by the
men.  With the patriarchal family, and still more with the single
monogamous family, a change came.  Household management lost its public
character.  It no longer concerned society.  It became a <i>private
service</i>; the wife became the head servant, excluded from all
participation in social production.  Not until the coming of modern
large-scale industry was the road to social production opened to her
again &#8211; and then only to the proletarian wife.  But it was opened in
such a manner that, if she carries out her duties in the private
service of her family, she remains excluded from public production and
unable to earn; and if she wants to take part in public production and
earn independently, she cannot carry out family duties.  And the wife&#8217;s
position in the factory is the position of women in all branches of
business, right up to medicine and the law.  The modern individual
family is founded on the open or concealed domestic slavery of the
wife, and modern society is a mass composed of these individual
families as its molecules.
</P>

<P>
In the great majority of cases today, at least in the possessing
classes, the husband is obliged to earn a living and support his
family, and that in itself gives him a position of supremacy, without
any need for special legal titles and privileges.  Within the family he
is the bourgeois and the wife represents the proletariat.  In the
industrial world, the specific character of the economic oppression
burdening the proletariat is visible in all its sharpness only when all
special legal privileges of the capitalist class have been abolished
and complete legal equality of both classes established.  The
democratic republic does not do away with the opposition of the two
classes; on the contrary, it provides the clear field on which the
fight can be fought out.  And in the same way, the peculiar character
of the supremacy of the husband over the wife in the modern family, the
necessity of creating real social equality between them, and the way to
do it, will only be seen in the clear light of day when both possess
legally complete equality of rights.  Then it will be plain that the
first condition for the liberation of the wife is to bring the whole
female sex back into public industry, and that this in turn demands the
abolition of the monogamous family as the economic unit of society.

We thus have three principal forms of marriage which correspond broadly
to the three principal stages of human development.  For the period of
savagery, group marriage; for barbarism, pairing marriage; for
civilization, monogamy, supplemented by adultery and prostitution. 
Between pairing marriage and monogamy intervenes a period in the upper
stage of barbarism when men have female slaves at their command and
polygamy is practiced.
</P>

<P>
As our whole presentation has shown, the progress which manifests
itself in these successive forms is connected with the peculiarity that
women, but not men, are increasingly deprived of the sexual freedom of
group marriage.  In fact, for men group marriage actually still exists
even to this day.  What for the woman is a crime, entailing grave legal
and social consequences, is considered honorable in a man or, at the
worse, a slight moral blemish which he cheerfully bears.  But the more
the hetaerism of the past is changed in our time by capitalist
commodity production and brought into conformity with it, the more,
that is to say, it is transformed into undisguised prostitution, the
more demoralizing are its effects.  And it demoralizes men far more
than women.  Among women, prostitution degrades only the unfortunate
ones who become its victims, and even these by no means to the extent
commonly believed.  But it degrades the character of the whole male
world.  A long engagement, particularly, is in nine cases out of ten a
regular preparatory school for conjugal infidelity.
</P>

<P>
We are now approaching a social revolution in which the economic
foundations of monogamy as they have existed hitherto will disappear
just as surely as those of its complement-prostitution.  Monogamy arose
from the concentration of considerable wealth in the hands of a single
individual &#8211; a man &#8211; and from the need to bequeath this wealth to the
children of that man and of no other.  For this purpose, the monogamy
of the woman was required, not that of the man, so this monogamy of the
woman did not in any way interfere with open or concealed polygamy on
the part of the man.  But by transforming by far the greater portion,
at any rate, of permanent, heritable wealth &#8211; the means of production
&#8211; into social property, the coming social revolution will reduce to a
minimum all this anxiety about bequeathing and inheriting.  Having
arisen from economic causes, will monogamy then disappear when these
causes disappear?
</P>

<P>
One might answer, not without reason: far from disappearing, it will,
on the contrary, be realized completely.  For with the transformation
of the means of production into social property there will  disappear
also  wage-labor, the proletariat, and therefore the necessity for a
certain &#8211; statistically calculable &#8211; number of women to surrender
themselves  for money.  Prostitution disappears; monogamy, instead of
collapsing,  at last becomes a reality &#8211; also for men.
</P>

<P>
In any case, therefore, the position of men will be very much altered. 
But the position of women, of <i>all</i> women, also undergoes significant
change.  With the transfer of the means of production into common
ownership, the single family ceases to be the economic unit of society.
 Private housekeeping is transformed into a social industry.  The care
and education of the children becomes a public affair; society looks
after all children alike, whether they are legitimate or not.  This
removes all the anxiety about the &#8220;consequences,&#8221; which today is the
most essential social &#8211; moral as well as economic &#8211; factor that
prevents a girl from giving herself completely to the man she loves. 
Will not that suffice to bring about the gradual growth of
unconstrained sexual intercourse and with it a more tolerant public
opinion in regard to a maiden&#8217;s honor and a woman&#8217;s shame?  And,
finally, have we not seen that in the modern world monogamy and
prostitution are indeed contradictions, but inseparable contradictions,
poles of the same state of society?  Can prostitution disappear without
dragging monogamy with it into the abyss<a name="art2">?</a>
</P>

<P>
Here a new element comes into play, an element which, at the time when
monogamy was developing, existed at most in germ: individual sex-love.
</P>

<P>
Before the Middle Ages we cannot speak of individual sex-love.  That
personal beauty, close intimacy, similarity of tastes and so forth
awakened in people of opposite sex the desire for sexual intercourse,
that men and women were not totally indifferent regarding the partner
with whom they entered into this most intimate relationship &#8211; that
goes without saying.  But it is still a very long way to our sexual
love.  Throughout the whole of antiquity, marriages were arranged by
the parents, and the partners calmly accepted their choice.  What
little love there was between husband and wife in antiquity is not so
much subjective inclination as objective duty, not the cause of the
marriage, but its corollary.  Love relationships in the modern sense
only occur in antiquity outside official society.  The shepherds of
whose joys and sorrows in love Theocratus and Moschus sing, the Daphnis
and Chloe of Longus are all slaves who have no part in the state, the
free citizen&#8217;s sphere of life.  Except among slaves, we find love
affairs only as products of the disintegration of the old world and
carried on with women who also stand outside official society, with
<i>hetairai</i> &#8211; that is, with foreigners or freed slaves: in Athens from
the eve of its decline, in Rome under the Caesars.  If there were any
real love affairs between free men and free women, these occurred only
in the course of adultery.  And to the classical love poet of
antiquity, old Anacreon, sexual love in our sense mattered so little
that it did not even matter to him which sex his beloved was.
</P>

<P>
Our sexual love differs essentially from the simple sexual desire, the
Eros, of the ancients.  In the first place, it assumes that the person
loved returns the love; to this extent the woman is on an equal footing
with the man, whereas in the Eros of antiquity she was often not even
asked.  Secondly, our sexual love has a degree of intensity and
duration which makes both lovers feel that non-possession and
separation are a great, if not the greatest, calamity; to possess one
another, they risk high stakes, even life itself.  In the ancient world
this happened only, if at all, in adultery.  And, finally, there arises
a new moral standard in the judgment of a sexual relationship.  We do
not only ask, was it within or outside marriage? But also, did it
spring from love and reciprocated love or not?  Of course, this new
standard has fared no better in  feudal or bourgeois practice than all
the other standards of morality &#8211; it is ignored.  But neither does it
fare any worse.  It is recognized just as much as they are &#8211; in
theory, on paper.  And for the present it cannot ask anything more.
</P>

<P>
At the point where antiquity broke off its advance to sexual love, the
Middle Ages took it up again: in adultery.  We have already described
the knightly love which gave rise to the songs of dawn.  From the love
which strives to break up marriage to the love which is to be its
foundation there is still a long road, which chivalry never fully
traversed.  Even when we pass from the frivolous Latins to the virtuous
Germans, we find in the <i>Nibelungenlied</i> that, although in her heart
Kriemhild is as much in love with Siegfried as he is with her, yet when
Gunther announces that he has promised her to a knight he does not
name, she simply replies: &#8220;You have no need to ask me; as you bid me,
so will I ever be; whom you, lord, give me as husband, him will I
gladly take in troth.&#8221; It never enters her head that her love can be
even considered.  Gunther asks for Brunhild in marriage, and Etzel for
Kriemhild, though they have never seen them.  Similarly, in <i>Gutrun</i>,
Sigebant of Ireland asks for the Norwegian Ute, whom he has never seen,
Hetel of Hegelingen for Hilde of Ireland, and, finally, Siegfried of
Moorland, Hartmut of Ormany and Herwig of Seeland for Gutrun, and here
Gutrun&#8217;s acceptance of Herwig is for the first time voluntary.  As a
rule, the young prince&#8217;s bride is selected by his parents, if they are
still living, or, if not, by the prince himself, with the advice of the
great feudal lords, who have a weighty word to say in all these cases. 
Nor can it be otherwise.  For the knight or baron, as for the prince of
the land himself, marriage is a political act, an opportunity to
increase power by new alliances; the interest of the <i>house</i> must be
decisive, not the wishes of an individual.  What chance then is there
for love to have the final word in the making of a marriage?
</P>

<P>
The same thing holds for the guild member in the medieval towns.  The
very privileges protecting him, the guild charters with all their
clauses and rubrics, the intricate distinctions legally separating him
from other guilds, from the members of his own guild or from his
journeymen and apprentices, already made the circle narrow enough
within which he could look for a suitable wife.  And who in the circle
was the most suitable was decided under this complicated system most
certainly not by his individual preference but by the family interests.
</P>

<P>
In the vast majority of cases, therefore, marriage remained, up to the
close of the middle ages, what it had been from the start &#8211; a matter
which was not decided by the partners.  In the beginning, people were
already born married &#8211;married to an entire group of the opposite sex. 
In the later forms of group marriage similar relations probably
existed, but with the group continually contracting.  In the pairing
marriage it was customary for the mothers to settle the marriages of
their children; here, too, the decisive considerations are the new ties
of kinship, which are to give the young pair a stronger position in the
gens and tribe.  And when, with the preponderance of private over
communal property and the interest in its bequeathal, father-right and
monogamy gained supremacy, the dependence of marriages on economic
considerations became complete.  The <i>form</i> of marriage by purchase
disappears, the actual practice is steadily extended until not only the
woman but also the man acquires a price &#8211; not according to his
personal qualities, but according to his property.  That the mutual
affection of the people concerned should be the one paramount reason
for marriage, outweighing everything else, was and always had been
absolutely unheard of in the practice of the ruling classes; that sort
of thing only happened in romance &#8211; or among the oppressed classes,
who did not count.
</P>

<P>
Such was the state of things encountered by capitalist production when
it began to prepare itself, after the epoch of geographical
discoveries, to win world power by world trade and manufacture.  One
would suppose that this manner of marriage exactly suited it, and so it
did.  And yet &#8211; there are no limits to the irony of history &#8211;
capitalist production itself was to make the decisive breach in it.  By
changing all things into commodities, it dissolved all inherited and
traditional relationships, and, in place of time-honored custom and
historic right, it set up purchase and sale, &#8220;free&#8221; contract.  And the
English jurist, H. S. Maine, thought he had made a tremendous discovery
when he said that our whole progress in comparison with former epochs
consisted in the fact that we had passed &#8220;from status to contract,"
from inherited to freely contracted conditions &#8211; which, in so far as
it is correct, was already in <i>The Communist Manifesto</i> [<a href="../../1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm">Chapter II</a>].
</P>

<P>
But a contract requires people who can dispose freely of their persons,
actions, and possessions, and meet each other on the footing of equal
rights.  To create these &#8220;free&#8221; and &#8220;equal&#8221; people was one of the main
tasks of capitalist production.  Even though at the start it was
carried out only half-consciously, and under a religious disguise at
that, from the time of the Lutheran and Calvinist Reformation the
principle was established that man is only fully responsible for his
actions when he acts with complete freedom of will, and that it is a
moral duty to resist all coercion to an immoral act.  But how did this
fit in with the hitherto existing practice in the arrangement of
marriages?  Marriage, according to the bourgeois conception, was a
contract, a legal transaction, and the most important one of all,
because it disposed of two human beings, body and mind, for life. 
Formally, it is true, the contract at that time was entered into
voluntarily: without the assent of the persons concerned, nothing could
be done.  But everyone knew only too well how this assent was obtained
and who were the real contracting parties in the marriage.  But if real
freedom of decision was required for all other contracts, then why not
for this?  Had not the two young people to be coupled also the right to
dispose freely of themselves, of their bodies and organs?  Had not
chivalry brought sex-love into fashion, and was not its proper
bourgeois form, in contrast to chivalry&#8217;s adulterous love, the love of
husband and wife?  And if it was the duty of married people to love
each other, was it not equally the duty of lovers to marry each other
and nobody else?  Did not this right of the lovers stand higher than
the right of parents, relations, and other traditional marriage-brokers
and matchmakers?  If the right of free, personal discrimination broke
boldly into the Church and religion, how should it halt before the
intolerable claim of the older generation to dispose of the body, soul,
property, happiness, and unhappiness of the younger generation?
</P>

<P>
These questions inevitably arose at a time which was loosening all the
old ties of society and undermining all traditional conceptions.  The
world had suddenly grown almost ten times bigger; instead of one
quadrant of a hemisphere, the whole globe lay before the gaze of the
West Europeans, who hastened to take the other seven quadrants into
their possession.  And with the old narrow barriers of their homeland f
ell also the thousand-year-old barriers of the prescribed medieval way
of thought.  To the outward and the inward eye of man opened an
infinitely wider horizon.  What did a young man care about the approval
of respectability, or honorable guild privileges handed down for
generations, when the wealth of India beckoned to him, the gold and the
silver mines of Mexico and Potosi?  For the bourgeoisie, it was the
time of knight-errantry; they, too, had their romance and their
raptures of love, but on a bourgeois footing and, in the last analysis,
with bourgeois aims.
</P>

<P>
So it came about that the rising bourgeoisie, especially in Protestant
countries, where existing conditions had been most severely shaken,
increasingly recognized freedom of contract also in marriage, and
carried it into effect in the manner described.  Marriage remained
class marriage, but within the class the partners were conceded a
certain degree of freedom of choice.  And on paper, in ethical theory
and in poetic description, nothing was more immutably established than
that every marriage is immoral which does not rest on mutual sexual
love and really free agreement of husband and wife.  In short, the love
marriage was proclaimed as a human right, and indeed not only as a
<i>droit de l&#8217;homme</i>, one of the rights of man, but also, for once in a
way, as <i>droit de la femme</i>, one of the rights of woman.
</P>

<P>
This human right, however, differed in one respect from all other
so-called human rights.  While the latter, in practice, remain
restricted to the ruling class (the bourgeoisie), and are directly or
indirectly curtailed for the oppressed class (the proletariat), in the
case of the former the irony of history plays another of its tricks. 
The ruling class remains dominated by the familiar economic influences
and therefore only in exceptional cases does it provide instances of
really freely contracted marriages, while among the oppressed class, as
we have seen, these marriages are the rule.
</P>

<P>
Full freedom of marriage can therefore only be generally established
when the abolition of capitalist production and of the property
relations created by it has removed all the accompanying economic
considerations which still exert such a powerful influence on the
choice of a marriage partner.  For then there is no other motive left
except mutual inclination.
</P>

<P>
And as sexual love is by its nature exclusive &#8211; although at present
this exclusiveness is fully realized only in the woman &#8211; the marriage
based on sexual love is by its nature individual marriage.  We have
seen how right Bachofen was in regarding the advance from group
marriage to individual marriage as primarily due to the women.  Only
the step from pairing marriage to monogamy can be put down to the
credit of the men, and historically the essence of this was to make the
position of the women worse and the infidelities of the men easier.  If
now the economic considerations also disappear which made women put up
with the habitual infidelity of their husbands &#8211; concern for their own
means of existence and still more for their children&#8217;s future &#8211; then,
according to all previous experience, the equality of woman thereby
achieved will tend infinitely more to make men really monogamous than
to make women polyandrous.
</P>

<P>
But what will quite certainly disappear from monogamy are all the
features stamped upon it through its origin in property relations;
these are, in the first place, supremacy of the man, and, secondly,
indissolubility.  The supremacy of the man in marriage is the simple
consequence of his economic supremacy, and with the abolition of the
latter will disappear of itself.  The indissolubility of marriage is
partly a consequence of the economic situation in which monogamy arose,
partly tradition from the period when the connection between this
economic situation and monogamy was not yet fully understood and was
carried to extremes under a religious form.  Today it is already broken
through at a thousand points.  If only the marriage based on love is
moral, then also only the marriage in which love continues.  But the
intense emotion of individual sex-love varies very much in duration
from one individual to another, especially among men, and if affection
definitely comes to an end or is supplanted by a new passionate love,
separation is a benefit for both partners as well as for society &#8211;
only people will then be spared having to wade through the useless mire
of a divorce case.
</P>

<P>
What we can now conjecture about the way in which sexual relations will
be ordered after the impending overthrow of capitalist production is
mainly of a negative character, limited for the most part to what will
disappear.  But what will there be new?  That will be answered when a
new generation has grown up: a generation of men who never in their
lives have known what it is to buy a woman&#8217;s surrender with money or
any other social instrument of power; a generation of women who have
never known what it is to give themselves to a man from any other
considerations than real love, or to refuse to give themselves to their
lover from fear of the economic consequences.  When these people are in
the world, they will care precious little what anybody today thinks
they ought to do; they will make their own practice and their
corresponding public opinion about the practice of each individual &#8211;
and that will be the end of it.
</P>

<P>
Let us, however, return to Morgan, from whom we have moved a
considerable distance.  The historical investigation of the social
institutions developed during the period of civilization goes beyond
the limits of his book.  How monogamy fares during this epoch,
therefore, only occupies him very briefly.  He, too, sees in the
further development of the monogamous family a step forward, an
approach to complete equality of the sexes, though he does not regard
this goal as attained.  But, he says:
</P>

<P class="quote">
     When the fact is accepted that the family has passed through four
     successive forms, and is now in a fifth, the question at once
     arises whether this form can be permanent in the future.  The only
     answer that can be given is that it must advance as society
     advances, and change as society changes, even as it has done in
     the past.  It is the creature of the social system, and will
     reflect its culture.  As the monogamian family has improved
     greatly since the commencement of civilization, and very sensibly
     in modern times, it is at least supposable that it is capable of
     still further improvement until the equality of the sexes is
     attained.  Should the monogamian family in the distant future fail
     to answer the requirements of society ... it is impossible to
     predict the nature of its successor.
