<p class="fst"><span class="cap">M</span>ORGAN, who spent a great part of his
life among the Iroquois Indians &ndash; settled to this day in New York State
&ndash; and was adopted into one of their tribes (the Senecas), found in use
among them a system of consanguinity which was in contradiction to their actual
family relationships. There prevailed among them a form of monogamy easily
terminable on both sides, which Morgan calls the &ldquo;pairing family.&rdquo;
The issue of the married pair was therefore known and recognized by everybody:
there could be no doubt about whom to call father, mother, son, daughter,
brother, sister. But these names were actually used quite differently. The
Iroquois calls not only his own children his sons and daughters, but also the
children of his brothers; and they call him father. The children of his
sisters, however, he calls his nephews and nieces, and they call him their
uncle. The Iroquois woman, on the other hand, calls her sisters&rsquo;
children, as well as her own, her sons and daughters, and they call her mother.
But her brothers&rsquo; children she calls her nephews and nieces, and she is
known as their aunt. Similarly, the children of brothers call one another
brother and sister, and so do the children of sisters. A woman's own children
and the children of her brother, on the other hand, call one another cousins.
And these are not mere empty names, but expressions of actual conceptions of
nearness and remoteness, of equality and difference in the degrees of
consanguinity: these conceptions serve as the foundation of a fully elaborated
system of consanguinity through which several hundred different relationships
of one individual can be expressed. What is more, this system is not only in
full force among all American Indians (no exception has been found up to the
present), but also retains its validity almost unchanged among the aborigines
of India, the Dravidian tribes in the Deccan and the Gaura tribes in Hindustan.
To this day the Tamils of southern India and the Iroquois Seneca Indians in New
York State still express more than two hundred degrees of consanguinity in the
same manner. And among these tribes of India, as among all the American
Indians, the actual relationships arising out of the existing form of the
family contradict the system of consanguinity. </p>

<p>How is this to be explained? In view of the decisive part played by
consanguinity in the social structure of all savage and barbarian peoples, the
importance of a system so widespread cannot be dismissed with phrases. When a
system is general throughout America and also exists in Asia among peoples of a
quite different race, when numerous instances of it are found with greater or
less variation in every part of Africa and Australia, then that system has to
be historically explained, not talked out of existence, as McLennan, for
example, tried to do. The names of father, child, brother, sister are no mere
complimentary forms of address; they involve quite definite and very serious
mutual obligations which together make up an essential part of the social
constitution of the peoples in question. </p>

<p>The explanation was found. In the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) there still
existed in the first half of the nineteenth century a form of family in which
the fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, uncles and
aunts, nephews and nieces were exactly what is required by the American and old
Indian system of consanguinity. But now comes a strange thing. Once again, the
system of consanguinity in force in Hawaii did not correspond to the actual
form of the Hawaiian family. For according to the Hawaiian system of
consanguinity all children of brothers and sisters are without exception
brothers and sisters of one another and are considered to be the common
children not only of their mother and her sisters or of their father and his
brothers, but of all the brothers and sisters of both their parents without
distinction. While, therefore, the American system of consanguinity presupposes
a more primitive form of the family which has disappeared in America, but still
actually exists in Hawaii, the Hawaiian system of consanguinity, on the other
hand, points to a still earlier form of the family which, though we can nowhere
prove it to be still in existence, nevertheless <i>must</i> have existed; for
otherwise the corresponding system of consanguinity could never have arisen.
</p>

<p class="quote">The family [says Morgan] represents an active principle. It is
never stationary, but advances from a lower to a higher form as society
advances from a lower to a higher condition ... Systems of consanguinity, on
the contrary, are passive; recording the progress made by the family at long
intervals apart, and only changing radically when the family has radically
changed. </p>

<p class="inline">[Morgan, op. cit., p. 444. &ndash; Ed.] </p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; adds Marx, &ldquo;the same is true of the political,
juridical, religious, and philosophical systems in general.&rdquo; While the
family undergoes living changes, the system of consanguinity ossifies; while
the system survives by force of custom, the family outgrows it. But just as
Cuvier could deduce from the marsupial bone of an animal skeleton found near
Paris that it belonged to a marsupial animal and that extinct marsupial animals
once lived there, so with the same certainty we can deduce from the historical
survival of a system of consanguinity that an extinct form of family once
existed which corresponded to it. </p>

<p>The systems of consanguinity and the forms of the family we have just
mentioned differ from those of today in the fact that every child has more than
one father and mother. In the American system of consanguinity, to which the
Hawaiian family corresponds, brother and sister cannot be the father and mother
of the same child; but the Hawaiian system of consanguinity, on the contrary,
presupposes a family in which this was the rule. Here we find ourselves among
forms of family which directly contradict those hitherto generally assumed to
be alone valid. The traditional view recognizes only monogamy, with, in
addition, polygamy on the part of individual men, and at the very most
polyandry on the part of individual women; being the view of moralizing
philistines, it conceals the fact that in practice these barriers raised by
official society are quietly and calmly ignored. The study of primitive
history, however, reveals conditions where the men live in polygamy and their
wives in polyandry at the same time, and their common children are therefore
considered common to them all &ndash; and these conditions in their turn
undergo a long series of changes before they finally end in monogamy. The trend
of these changes is to narrow more and more the circle of people comprised
within the common bond of marriage, which was originally very wide, until at
last it includes only the single pair, the dominant form of marriage today. </p>
<a name="1.1"></a> 

<p>Reconstructing thus the past history of the family, Morgan, in agreement
with most of his colleagues, arrives at a primitive stage when unrestricted
sexual freedom prevailed within the tribe, every woman belonging equally to
every man and every man to every woman. Since the eighteenth century there had
been talk of such a primitive state, but only in general phrases. Bachofen
&ndash; and this is one of his great merits &ndash; was the first to take the
existence of such a state seriously and to search for its traces in historical
and religious survivals. Today we know that the traces he found do not lead
back to a social stage of promiscuous sexual intercourse, but to a much later
form &ndash; namely, group marriage. The primitive social stage of promiscuity,
if it ever existed, belongs to such a remote epoch that we can hardly expect to
prove its existence <i>directly</i> by discovering its social fossils among backward
savages. Bachofen's merit consists in having brought this question to the
forefront for examination. <span class="note"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span> </p>

<p>Lately it has become fashionable to deny the existence of this initial stage
in human sexual life. Humanity must be spared this &ldquo;shame.&rdquo; It is
pointed out that all direct proof of such a stage is lacking, and particular
appeal is made to the evidence from the rest of the animal world; for, even
among animals, according to the numerous facts collected by Letourneau
(<em>L'évolution du mariage et de la famille</em>, 1888), complete promiscuity in
sexual intercourse marks a low stage of development. But the only conclusion I
can draw from all these facts, so far as man and his primitive conditions of
life are concerned, is that they prove nothing whatever. That vertebrates mate
together for a considerable period is sufficiently explained by physiological
causes &ndash; in the case of birds, for example, by the female&rsquo;s need of
help during the brooding period; examples of faithful monogamy among birds
prove nothing about man, for the simple reason that men are not descended from
birds. And if strict monogamy is the height of all virtue, then the palm must
go to the tapeworm, which has a complete set of male and female sexual organs
in each of its 50-200 proglottides, or sections, and spends its whole life
copulating in all its sections with itself. Confining ourselves to mammals,
however, we find all forms of sexual life &ndash; promiscuity, indications of
group marriage, polygyny, monogamy. Polyandry alone is lacking &ndash; it took
human beings to achieve that. Even our nearest relations, the quadrumana,
exhibit every possible variation in the grouping of males and females; and if
we narrow it down still more and consider only the four anthropoid apes, all
that Letourneau has to say about them is that they are sometimes monogamous,
sometimes polygamous, while Saussure, quoted by Giraud-Teulon, maintains that
they are monogamous. The more recent assertions of the monogamous habits of the
anthropoid apes which are cited by Westermarck (<em>The History of Human
Marriage, </em>London 1891), are also very far from proving anything. In short,
our evidence is such that honest Letourneau admits: &ldquo;Among mammals there
is no strict relation between the degree of intellectual development and the
form of sexual life.&rdquo; And Espinas (<em>Des sociétés animates</em>, 1877),
says in so many words: </p>

<p class="quote">The herd is the highest social group which we can observe
among animals. It is composed, <i>so it appears</i>, of families, but from the start
<i>the family and the herd are in conflict with one another</i> and develop in inverse
proportion. </p>

<p>As the above shows, we know practically nothing definite about the family
and other social groupings of the anthropoid apes; the evidence is flatly
contradictory. Which is not to be wondered at. The evidence with regard to
savage human tribes is contradictory enough, requiring very critical
examination and sifting; and ape societies are far more difficult to observe
than human. For the present, therefore, we must reject any conclusion drawn
from such completely unreliable reports. </p>

<p>The sentence quoted from Espinas, however, provides a better starting point.
Among the higher animals the herd and the family are not complementary to one
another, but antagonistic. Espinas shows very well how the jealousy of the
males during the mating season loosens the ties of every social herd or
temporarily breaks it up. </p>

<p class="quote">When the family bond is close and exclusive, herds form only
in exceptional cases. When on the other hand free sexual intercourse or
polygamy prevails, the herd comes into being almost spontaneously ... Before a
herd can be formed, family ties must be loosened and the individual must have
become free again. This is the reason why organized flocks are so rarely found
among birds ... We find more or less organized societies among mammals,
however, precisely because here the individual is not merged in the family ...
In its first growth, therefore, the common feeling of the herd has no greater
enemy than the common feeling of the family. We state it without hesitation:
only by absorbing families which had undergone a radical change could a social
form higher than the family have developed; at the same time, these families
were thereby enabled later to constitute themselves afresh under infinitely
more favorable circumstances. </p>

<p class="inline">[Espinas, op. cit., quoted by Giraud-Teulon, <i>Origines du
mariage et de la famille</i>,<br>
1884, pp. 518-20]. </p>

<p>Here we see that animal societies are, after all, of some value for drawing
conclusions about human societies; but the value is only negative. So far as
our evidence goes, the higher vertebrates know only two forms of family &ndash;
polygyny or separate couples; each form allows only <i>one</i> adult male, only one
husband. The jealousy of the male, which both consolidates and isolates the
family, sets the animal family in opposition to the herd. The jealousy of the
males prevents the herd, the higher social form, from coming into existence, or
weakens its cohesion, or breaks it up during the mating period; at best, it
attests its development. This alone is sufficient proof that animal families
and primitive human society are incompatible, and that when primitive men were
working their way up from the animal creation, they either had no family at all
or a form that does not occur among animals. In small numbers, an animal so
defenseless as evolving man might struggle along even in conditions of
isolation, with no higher social grouping than the single male and female pair,
such as Westermarck, following the reports of hunters, attributes to the
gorillas and the chimpanzees. For man's development beyond the level of the
animals, for the achievement of the greatest advance nature can show, something
more was needed: the power of defense lacking to the individual had to be made
good by the united strength and co-operation of the herd. To explain the
transition to humanity from conditions such as those in which the anthropoid
apes live today would be quite impossible; it looks much more as if these apes
had strayed off the line of evolution and were gradually dying out or at least
degenerating. That alone is sufficient ground for rejecting all attempts based
on parallels drawn between forms of family and those of primitive man. Mutual
toleration among the adult males, freedom from jealousy, was the first
condition for the formation of those larger, permanent groups in which alone
animals could become men. And what, in fact, do we find to be the oldest and
most primitive form of family whose historical existence we can indisputably
prove and which in one or two parts of the world we can still study today?
Group marriage, the form of family in which whole groups of men and whole
groups of women mutually possess one another, and which leaves little room for
jealousy. And at a later stage of development we find the exceptional form of
polyandry, which positively revolts every jealous instinct and is therefore
unknown among animals. But as all known forms of group marriage are accompanied
by such peculiarly complicated regulations that they necessarily point to
earlier and simpler forms of sexual relations, and therefore in the last resort
to a period of promiscuous intercourse corresponding to the transition from the
animal to the human, the references to animal marriages only bring us back to
the very point from which we were to be led away for good and all. </p>

<p>What, then, does promiscuous sexual intercourse really mean? It means the
absence of prohibitions and restrictions which are or have been in force. We
have already seen the barrier of jealousy go down. If there is one thing
certain, it is that the feeling of jealousy develops relatively late. The same
is true of the conception of incest. Not only were brother and sister
originally man and wife; sexual intercourse between parents and children is
still permitted among many peoples today. Bancroft (<em>The Native Races of the
Pacific States of North America</em>, 1875, Vol. I), testifies to it among the
Kadiaks on the Behring Straits, the Kadiaks near Alaska, and the Tinneh in the
interior of British North America; Letourneau compiled reports of it among the
Chippewa Indians, the Cucus in Chile, the Caribs, the Karens in Burma; to say
nothing of the stories told by the old Greeks and Romans about the Parthians,
Persians, Scythians, Huns, and so on. Before incest was invented &ndash; for
incest is an invention, and a very valuable one, too &ndash; sexual intercourse
between parents and children did not arouse any more repulsion than sexual
intercourse between other persons of different generations, and that occurs
today even in the most philistine countries without exciting any great horror;
even &ldquo;old maids&rdquo; of over sixty, if they are rich enough, sometimes
marry young men in their thirties. But if we consider the most primitive known
forms of family apart from their conceptions of incest &ndash; conceptions
which are totally different from ours and frequently in direct contradiction to
them-then the form of sexual intercourse can only be described as promiscuous
&ndash; promiscuous in so far as the restrictions later established by custom
did not yet exist. But in everyday practice that by no means necessarily
implies general mixed mating. Temporary pairings of one man with one woman were
not in any way excluded, just as in the cases of group marriages today the
majority of relationships are of this character. And when Westermarck, the
latest writer to deny the existence of such a primitive state, applies the term
&ldquo;marriage&rdquo; to every relationship in which the two sexes remain
mated until the birth of the offspring, we must point out that this kind of
marriage can very well occur under the conditions of promiscuous intercourse
without contradicting the principle of promiscuity &ndash; the absence of any
restriction imposed by custom on sexual intercourse. Westermarck, however,
takes the standpoint that promiscuity &ldquo;involves a suppression of
individual inclinations,&rdquo; and that therefore &ldquo;the most genuine form
of it is prostitution.&rdquo; In my opinion, any understanding of primitive
society is impossible to people who only see it as a brothel. We will return to
this point when discussing group marriage. </p>

<p>According to Morgan, from this primitive state of promiscuous intercourse
there developed, probably very early: </p>

<h3>1. The Consanguine Family, The First Stage of the Family </h3>
<a name="2-3"></a> 

<p>Here the marriage groups are separated according to generations: all the
grandfathers and grandmothers within the limits of the family are all husbands
and wives of one another; so are also their children, the fathers and mothers;
the latter&rsquo;s children will form a third circle of common husbands and
wives; and their children, the great-grandchildren of the first group, will
form a fourth. In this form of marriage, therefore, only ancestors and progeny,
and parents and children, are excluded from the rights and duties (as we should
say) of marriage with one another. Brothers and sisters, male and female
cousins of the first, second, and more remote degrees, are all brothers and
sisters of one another, and <i>precisely for that reason</i> they are all husbands and
wives of one another. At this stage the relationship of brother and sister also
includes as a matter of course the practice of sexual intercourse with one
another. <span class="note"><a href="#2"><sup
class="enote">[2]</sup></a></span> In its typical form, such a family would
consist of the descendants of a single pair, the descendants of these
descendants in each generation being again brothers and sisters, and therefore
husbands and wives, of one another. <span class="note"><a href="#3"><sup
class="enote">[3]</sup></a></span> </p>

<p>The consanguine family is extinct. Even the most primitive peoples known to
history provide no demonstrable instance of it. But that it <i>must</i> have existed,
we are compelled to admit: for the Hawaiian system of consanguinity still
prevalent today throughout the whole of Polynesia expresses degrees of
consanguinity which could only arise in this form of family; and the whole
subsequent development of the family presupposes the existence of the
consanguine family as a necessary preparatory stage. </p>

<a name="1"></a> 

<p class="fst"><strong><a href="#1.1">[1]</a></strong> Bachofen proves how
little he understood his own discovery, or rather his guess, by using the term
"hetaerism" to describe this primitive state. For the Greeks, when they
introduced the word, hetaerism meant intercourse of men, unmarried or living in
monogamy, with unmarried women, it always presupposes a definite form of
marriage outside which this intercourse takes place and includes at least the
possibility of prostitution. The word was never used in any other sense, and it
is in this sense that I use it with Morgan. Bachofen everywhere introduces into
his extremely important discoveries the most incredible mystifications through
his notion that in their historical development the relations between men and
women had their origin in men's contemporary religious conceptions, not in
their actual conditions of life. </p>
<a name="2"></a> 

<p class="fst"><strong><a href="#2-3">[2]</a></strong> In a letter written in
the spring of 1882, Marx expresses himself in the strongest terms about the
complete misrepresentation of primitive times in Wager's text to the
Nibelangen: &ldquo; Have such things been heard, that brother embraced
sister as a bride?&rdquo; To Wagner and his &ldquo; lecherous
gods&rdquo; who, quite in the modern manner, spice their love affairs with
a little incest, Marx replies: &ldquo; In primitive times the sister was
the wife, and that was moral.&rdquo;  </p>
<br>
<a name="3"></a> 

<p class="fst"><strong><a href="#2-3">[3]</a></strong> NOTE in Fourth edition:
A French friend of mine who is an admirer of Wagner is not in agreement with
this note. He observes that already in the Elder Edda, on which Wagner based
his story, in the <i>Oegisdrekka</i>, Loki makes the reproach to Freya: In the
sight of the gods thou didst embrace thine own brother." Marriage between
brother and sister, he argues, was therefore forbidden already at that time.
The <i>Oegisdrekka</i> is the expression of a time when belief in the old myths had
completely broken down; it is purely a satire on the gods, in the style of
Lucian. If Loki as Mephisto makes such a reproach to Freya, it tells rather
against Wagner. Loki also says some lines later to Niordhr: &ldquo; With
thy sister didst thou breed son.&rdquo; (<i>vidh systur thinni gaztu slikan
mög</i>) Niordhr is not, indeed, an Asa, but a Vana, and says in the Ynglinga saga
that marriages between brothers and sisters are usual in Vanaland, which was
not the case among the Asas. This would seem to show that the Vanas were more
ancient gods the Asas. At any rate, Niordhr lives among the OEgisdrekka is
rather a proof that at the time when the Norse sagas of the gods arose,
marriages between brothers and sisters, at any rate among the gods, did not yet
excite any horror. If one wants to find excuses for Wagner, it would perhaps be
better to cite Goethe instead of the Edda, for in his ballad of the God and the
Bayadere Goethe commits a similar mistake in regard to the religious surrender
of women, which he makes far too similar to modern prostitution. </p>
