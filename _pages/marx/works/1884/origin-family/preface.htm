<p class="fst"><span class="cap">T</span>he following chapters are, in a sense,
the execution of a bequest. No less a man than Karl Marx had made it one of his
future tasks to present the results of Morgan&rsquo;s researches in the light of the
conclusions of his own &mdash; within certain limits, I may say our &mdash; materialistic
examination of history, and thus to make clear their full significance. For
Morgan in his own way had discovered afresh in America the materialistic
conception of history discovered by Marx forty years ago, and in his comparison
of barbarism and civilization it had led him, in the main points, to the same
conclusions as Marx. And just as the professional economists in Germany were
for years as busy in plagiarizing Capital as they were persistent in attempting
to kill it by silence, so Morgan's Ancient Society <span class="note"><a
href="#1"><sup class="enote">[1]</sup></a></span> received precisely the same treatment from the
spokesmen of &ldquo;prehistoric&rdquo; science in England. My work can only provide a
slight substitute for what my departed friend no longer had the time to do. But
I have the critical notes which he made to his extensive extracts from Morgan,
and as far as possible I reproduce them here. </p>

<p>According to the materialistic conception, the determining factor in history
is, in the final instance, the production and reproduction of the immediate
essentials of life. This, again, is of a twofold character. On the one side,
the production of the means of existence, of articles of food and clothing,
dwellings, and of the tools necessary for that production; on the other side,
the production of human beings themselves, the propagation of the species. The
social organization under which the people of a particular historical epoch and
a particular country live is determined by both kinds of production: by the
stage of development of labor on the one hand and of the family on the other.
</p>

<p>The lower the development of labor and the more limited the amount of its
products, and consequently, the more limited also the wealth of the society,
the more the social order is found to be dominated by kinship groups. However,
within this structure of society based on kinship groups the productivity of
labor increasingly develops, and with it private property and exchange,
differences of wealth, the possibility of utilizing the labor power of others,
and hence the basis of class antagonisms: new social elements, which in the
course of generations strive to adapt the old social order to the new
conditions, until at last their incompatibility brings about a complete
upheaval. In the collision of the newly-developed social classes, the old
society founded on kinship groups is broken up; in its place appears a new
society, with its control centered in the state, the subordinate units of which
are no longer kinship associations, but local associations; a society in which
the system of the family is completely dominated by the system of property, and
in which there now freely develop those class antagonisms and class struggles
that have hitherto formed the content of all <em>written</em> history. </p>

<p>It is Morgan&rsquo;s great merit that he has discovered and reconstructed in its
main lines this prehistoric basis of our written history, and that in the
kinship groups of the North American Indians he has found the key to the most
important and hitherto insoluble riddles of earliest Greek, Roman and German
history. His book is not the work of a day. For nearly forty years he wrestled
with his material, until he was completely master of it. But that also makes
his book one of the few epoch-making works of our time. </p>

<p>In the following presentation, the reader will in general easily distinguish
what comes from Morgan and what I have added. In the historical sections on
Greece and Rome I have not confined myself to Morgan&rsquo;s evidence, but have added
what was available to me. The sections on the Celts and the Germans are in the
main my work; Morgan had to rely here almost entirely on secondary sources, and
for German conditions &mdash; apart from Tacitus &mdash; on the worthless and
liberalistic falsifications of Mr. Freeman. The treatment of the economic
aspects, which in Morgan&rsquo;s book was sufficient for his purpose but quite
inadequate for mine, has been done afresh by myself. And, finally, I am, of
course, responsible for all the conclusions drawn, in so far as Morgan is not
expressly cited. </p>
