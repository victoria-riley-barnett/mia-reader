Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State </p>

<h1>VI. The Gens and the State in Rome</h1>
<hr size="1" width="88%">
<br>
<a name="1.1"></a> 

<p class="fst">According to the legendary account of the foundation of Rome,
the first settlement was established by a number of Latin <em>gentes</em> <span
class="NOTE"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span> (one hundred, says the legend), who
were united in a tribe; these were soon joined by a Sabellian tribe, also said
to have numbered a hundred gentes, and lastly by a third tribe of mixed
elements, again said to have been composed of a hundred gentes. The whole
account reveals at the first glance that very little was still primitive here
except the gens, and that even it was in some cases only an offshoot from a
mother gens still existing in its original home. The tribes clearly bear the
mark of their artificial composition, even though they are generally composed
out of related elements and after the pattern of the old tribe, which was not
made but grew; it is, however, not an impossibility that the core of each of
the three tribes was a genuine old tribe. The intermediate group, the phratry,
consisted of ten gentes and was called a <i>curia</i>; there were therefore thirty
<i>curiae</i>. </p>

<p>The Roman gens is recognized to be the same institution as the Greek gens;
and since the Greek gens is a further development of the social unit whose
original form is found among the American Indians, this, of course, holds true
of the Roman gens also. Here therefore we can be more brief. </p>

<p>The Roman gens, at least in the earliest times of Rome, had the following
constitution: </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">1. Mutual right of inheritance
among gentile members; the property remained within the gens. Since
father-right already prevailed in the Roman gens as in the Greek, descendants
in the female line were excluded. According to the Law of the Twelve Tables,
the oldest written Roman law known to us, the children, as natural heirs, had
the first title to the estate; in default of children, then the agnates
(descendants in the <i>male</i> line); in default of agnates, the gentiles. In all
cases the property remained within the gens. Here we see gentile custom
gradually being penetrated by the new legal provisions springing from increased
wealth and monogamy: the original equal right of inheritance of all members of
the gens is first restricted in practice to the agnates &ndash; probably very early, as
already mentioned &ndash; finally, to the children and their issue in the male line;
in the Twelve Tables this appears, of course, in the reverse order. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">2. Possession of a common burial
place. On their immigration to Rome from Regilli, the patrician gens of the
Claudii received a piece of land for their own use and also a common burial
place in the town. Even in the time of Augustus, the head of Varus, who had
fallen in the battle of the Teutoburg Forest, was brought to Rome and interred
in the <i>gentilitius tumulus</i> (mound of the gens); the gens (Quinctilia) therefore still had its own
burial mound. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">3. Common religious rites. These,
the <i>sacra gentilitia</i>, are well known. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">4. Obligation not to marry within
the gens. This seems never to have become written law in Rome, but the custom
persisted. Of all the countless Roman married couples whose names have been
preserved, there is not one where husband and wife have the same gentile name.
The law of inheritance also proves the observance of this rule. The woman loses
her agnatic rights on marriage and leaves her gens; neither she nor her
children can inherit from her father or his brothers, because otherwise the
inheritance would be lost to the father&rsquo;s gens. There is no sense in this
rule unless a woman may not marry a member of her own gens. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">5. Common land. In primitive
times the gens had always owned common land, ever since the tribal land began
to be divided up. Among the Latin tribes, we find the land partly in the
possession of the tribe, partly of the gens, and partly of the households,
which at that time can hardly have been single families. Romulus is said to
have made the first allotments of land to individuals, about two and one-half
acres (two <i>jugera</i>) to a person. But later we still find land owned by the
gentes, to say nothing of the state land, round which the whole internal
history of the republic centers. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">6. Obligation of mutual
protection and help among members of the gens. Only vestiges remain in written
history; from the very start the Roman state made its superior power so
manifest that the right of protection against injury passed into its hands.
When Appius Claudius was arrested, the whole of his gens, even those who were
his personal enemies, put on mourning. At the time of the second Punic war the
gentes joined together to ransom their members who had been taken prisoner; the
senate prohibited them from doing so. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">7. Right to bear the gentile
name. Persisted till the time of the emperors; freedmen were allowed to use the
gentile name of their former master, but without gentile rights. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">8. Right to adopt strangers into
the gens. This was done through adoption into a family (as among the Indians),
which carried with it acceptance into the gens. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">9. The right to elect the chief
and to depose him is nowhere mentioned. But since in the earliest days of Rome
all offices were filled by election or nomination, from the elected king
downwards, and since the priests of the <i>curiae</i> were also elected by the <i>curiae</i>
themselves, we may assume the same procedure for the presidents (<i>principes</i>) of
the gentes &ndash; however firmly established the election from one and the same family
within the gens may have already become. </p>

<p>Such were the rights of a Roman gens. Apart from the already completed
transition to father-right, they are the perfect counterpart of the rights and
duties in an Iroquois gens; here again &ldquo;the Iroquois shows through
unmistakably&rdquo; (p. 90). </p>

<p>The confusion that still exists today, even among our leading historians, on
the subject of the Roman gens, may be illustrated by one example. In his paper
on Roman family names in the period of the Republic and of Augustus
(<em>Romische Forschungen</em>, Berlin, 1864, Vol. I, pp. 8-11) Mommsen writes:
</p>

<p class="quote">The gentile name belongs to all the male members of the gens,
excluding, of course, the slaves, but including adopted and protected persons;
it belongs also to the women ... The tribe [as Mommsen here translates <i>gens</i>]
is... a communal entity, derived from common lineage (real, supposed or even
pretended) and united by communal festivities, burial rites and laws of
inheritance; to it all personally free individuals, and therefore all women
also, may and must belong. But it is difficult to determine what gentile name
was borne by married women. So long as the woman may only marry a member of her
own gens, this problem does not arise; and there is evidence that for a long
period it was more difficult for women to marry outside than inside the gens;
for instance, so late as the sixth century [B.C.] the right of <i>gentis enuptio</i>
(marriage outside the gens) was a personal privilege, conceded as a reward ...
But when such marriages outside the tribe took place, the wife, in earliest
times, must thereby have gone over to her husband's tribe. Nothing is more
certain than that the woman, in the old religious marriage, enters completely
into the legal and sacramental bonds of her husband's community and leaves her
own. Everyone knows that the married woman forfeits the right of inheritance
and bequest in relation to members of her own gens but shares rights of
inheritance with her husband and children and the members of their gens. And if
she is adopted by her husband and taken into his family, how can she remain
apart from his gens? </p>

<p>Mommsen therefore maintains that the Roman women who belonged to a gens had
originally been permitted to marry only <i>within</i> the gens, that the gens had
therefore been endogamous, not exogamous. This view, which is in contradiction
to all the evidence from other peoples, rests chiefly, if not exclusively, on
one much disputed passage from Livy (Book XXXIX, Ch. 19), according to which
the senate in the year 568 after the foundation of the city, or 186 B.C.,
decreed: &ldquo;<i>Uti Feceniae Hispallae datio, deminutio, gentis enuptio, tutoris optio item esset quasi ei vir testamento dedisset; utique ei ingenuo nubere liceret, neu quid ei qui eam duxisset ob id fraudi ignominiaeve esset</i>&rdquo;
&ndash; that Fecenia Hispala shall have the right to dispose of her property,
to decrease it, to marry outside the gens, and to choose for herself a
guardian, exactly as if her (deceased) husband had conferred this right on her
by testament; that she may marry a freeman, and that the man who takes her to
wife shall not be considered to have committed a wrongful or shameful act
thereby. </p>

<p>Without a doubt, Fecenia, a freedwoman, is here granted the right to marry
outside the gens. And equally without a doubt the husband possessed the right,
according to this passage, to bequeath to his wife by will the right to marry
outside the gens after his death. But outside <i>which</i> gens? </p>

<p>If the woman had to marry within her gens, as Mommsen assumes, she remained
within this gens also after her marriage. But in the first place the endogamous
character of the gens which is here asserted is precisely what has to be
proved. And, secondly, if the wife had to marry within the gens, then, of
course, so had the man, for otherwise he could not get a wife. So we reach the
position that the man could bequeath to his wife by will a right which he
himself, and for himself, did not possess; we arrive at a legal absurdity.
Mommsen also feels this, and hence makes the assumption: &ldquo;For a lawful
marriage outside the gens, it was probably necessary to have the consent, not
only of the chief, but of all members of the gens.&rdquo; That is a very bold
assumption in the first place, and, secondly, it contradicts the clear wording
of the passage. The senate grants her this right <i>in the place of her husband</i>;
it grants her expressly neither more nor less than her husband could have
granted her, but what it grants her is an <i>absolute</i> right, conditional upon no
other restriction. Thus it is provided that if she makes use of this right, her
new husband also shall not suffer any disability. The senate even directs the
present and future consuls and praetors to see to it that no injurious
consequences to her follow. Mommsen&rsquo;s assumption therefore seems to be
completely inadmissible. </p>

<p>Or assume that the woman married a man from another gens, but herself
remained in the gens into which she had been born. Then, according to the above
passage, the man would have had the right to allow his wife to marry outside
her own gens. That is, he would have had the right to make dispositions in the
affairs of a gens to which he did not even belong. The thing is so patently
absurd that we need waste no more words on it. </p>

<p>Hence there only remains the assumption that in her first marriage the woman
married a man from another gens, and thereby immediately entered the gens of
her husband, which Mommsen himself actually admits to have been the practice
when the woman married outside her gens. Then everything at once becomes clear.
Severed from her old gens by her marriage and accepted into the gentile group
of her husband, the woman occupies a peculiar position in her new gens. She is,
indeed, a member of the gens, but not related by blood. By the mere manner of
her acceptance as a gentile member, she is entirely excluded from the
prohibition against marrying within the gens, for she has just married into it;
further, she is accepted as one of the married members of the gens, and on her
husband&rsquo;s death inherits from his property, the property of a gentile
member. What is more natural than that this property should remain within the
gens and that she should therefore be obliged to marry a member of her
husband&rsquo;s gens and nobody else? And if an exception is to be made, who is
so competent to give her the necessary authorization as the man who has
bequeathed her this property, her first husband? At the moment when he
bequeaths to her a part of his property and at the same time allows her to
transfer it into another gens through marriage or in consequence of marriage,
this property still belongs to him and he is therefore literally disposing of
his own property. As regards the woman herself and her relation to her
husband's gens, it was he who brought her into the gens by a free act of will -
the marriage; hence it also seems natural that he should be the proper person
to authorize her to leave this gens by a second marriage. In a word, the matter
appears simple and natural as soon as we abandon the extraordinary conception
of the endogamous Roman gens and regard it, with Morgan, as originally
exogamous. </p>

<p>There still remains one last assumption which has also found adherents, and
probably the most numerous. On this view, the passage only means that
&ldquo;freed servants (<i>libertae</i>) could not without special permission <i>e gente
enubere</i> (marry out of the gens) or perform any of the acts, which, involving
loss of rights (<i>capitis deminutio minima</i>), would have resulted in the <i>liberta</i>
leaving the gens.&rdquo; (Lange, <em>Römische Altertumer</em>, Berlin 1856, I,
195, where Huschke is cited in connection with our passage from Livy.) If this
supposition is correct, the passage then proves nothing at all about the
position of free Roman women, and there can be even less question of any
obligation resting on them to marry within the gens. </p>

<p>The expression <em>enuptio gentis</em> only occurs in this one passage and
nowhere else in the whole of Latin literature; the word <i>enubere</i>, to marry
outside, only occurs three times, also in Livy, and then not in reference to
the gens. The fantastic notion that Roman women were only allowed to marry
within their gens owes its existence solely to this one passage. But it cannot
possibly be maintained. For either the passage refers to special restrictions
for freedwomen, in which case it proves nothing about free women (<i>ingenuae</i>), or
it applies also to free women; and then it proves, on the contrary, that the
woman married as a rule outside her gens, but on her marriage entered into the
gens of her husband; which contradicts Mommsen and supports Morgan. </p>

<p>Almost three centuries after the foundation of Rome, the gentile groups were
still so strong that a patrician gens, that of the Fabii, was able to undertake
an independent campaign, with the permission of the senate, against the
neighboring town of Veii; three hundred and six Fabii are said to have set out
and to have been killed to a man, in an ambush; according to the story, only
one boy who had remained behind survived to propagate the gens. </p>

<p>As we have said, ten gentes formed a phratry, which among the Romans was
called a <i>curia</i> and had more important public functions than the Greek phratry.
Every <i>curia</i> had its own religious rites, shrines and priests; the latter, as a
body, formed one of the Roman priestly colleges. Ten <i>curiae</i> formed a tribe,
which probably, like the rest of the Latin tribes, originally had an elected
president-military leader and high priest. The three tribes together formed the
Roman people, the <i>Populus Romanus</i>. </p>
<a name="2.1"></a> 

<p>Thus no one could belong to the Roman people unless he was a member of a
gens and through it of a <i>curia</i> and a tribe. The first constitution of the Roman
people was as follows: Public affairs were managed in the first instance by the
senate, which, as Niebuhr first rightly saw, was composed of the presidents of
the three hundred gentes; it was because they were the elders of the gens that
they were called fathers, <i>patres</i>, and their body, the senate (council of the
elders, from <i>senex</i>, old). Here again the custom of electing always from the
same family in the gens brought into being the first hereditary nobility; these
families called themselves &ldquo;patricians,&rdquo; and claimed for themselves
exclusive right of entry into the senate and tenure of all other offices. The
acquiescence of the people in this claim, in course of time, and its
transformation into an actual right, appear in legend as the story that Romulus
conferred the patriciate and its privileges on the first senators and their
descendants. The senate, like the Athenian <i>boulè</i>, made final decisions in many
matters and held preparatory discussions on those of greater importance,
particularly new laws. With regard to these, the decision rested with the
assembly of the people, called the <i>comitia curiata</i> (assembly of the <i>curiae</i>).
The people assembled together, grouped in <i>curiae</i>, each <i>curia</i> probably grouped
in gentes; each of the thirty <i>curiae</i> had one vote in the final decision. The
assembly of the <i>curiae</i> accepted or rejected all laws, elected all higher
officials, including the <i>rex</i> (so-called king), declared war (the senate,
however, concluded peace), and, as supreme court, decided, on the appeal of the
parties concerned, all cases involving death sentence on a Roman citizen.
Lastly, besides the senate and the assembly of the people, there was the <i>rex</i>,
who corresponded exactly to the Greek <i>basileus</i> and was not at all the almost
absolute king which Mommsen made him out to be. <span class="NOTE"><a
href="#2"><sup class="enote">[2]</sup></a></span> He also was military leader,
high priest, and president of certain courts. He had no civil authority
whatever, nor any power over the life, liberty, or property of citizens, except
such as derived from his disciplinary powers as military leader or his
executive powers as president of a court. The office of <i>rex</i> was not hereditary;
on the contrary, he was first elected by the assembly of the <i>curiae</i>, probably
on the nomination of his predecessor, and then at a second meeting solemnly
installed in office. That he could also be deposed is shown by the fate of
Tarquinius Superbus. </p>

<p>Like the Greeks of the heroic age, the Romans in the age of the so-called
kings lived in a military democracy founded on gentes, phratries, and tribes
and developed out of them. Even if the <i>curiae</i> and tribes were to a certain
extent artificial groups, they were formed after the genuine, primitive models
of the society out of which they had arisen and by which they were still
surrounded on all sides. Even if the primitive patrician nobility had already
gained ground, even if the <i>reges</i> were endeavoring gradually to extend their
power, it does not change the original, fundamental character of the
constitution, and that alone matters. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rome and the Roman territory, which had been enlarged by
conquest, increased in population, partly through immigration, partly through
the addition of inhabitants of the subjugated, chiefly Latin, districts. All
these new citizens of the state (we leave aside the question of the clients)
stood outside the old gentes, <i>curiae</i>, and tribes, and therefore formed no part
of the <i>populus Romanus</i>, the real Roman people. They were personally free, could
own property in land, and had to pay taxes and do military service. But they
could not hold any office, nor take part in the assembly of the <i>curiae</i>, nor
share in the allotment of conquered state lands. They formed the class that was
excluded from all public rights, the <i>plebs</i>. Owing to their continually
increasing numbers, their military training and their possession of arms, they
became a powerful threat to the old <i>populus</i>, which now rigidly barred any
addition to its own ranks from outside. Further, landed property seems to have
been fairly equally divided between <i>populus</i> and <i>plebs</i>, while the commercial and
industrial wealth, though not as yet much developed, was probably for the most
part in the hands of the <i>plebs</i>. </p>

<p>The great obscurity which envelops the completely legendary primitive
history of Rome &ndash; an obscurity considerably deepened by the rationalistically
pragmatical interpretations and accounts given of the subject by later authors
with legalistic minds &ndash; makes it impossible to say anything definite about the
time, course, or occasion of the revolution which made an end of the old
gentile constitution. All that is certain is that its cause lay in the
struggles between <i>plebs</i> and <i>populus</i>. </p>

<p>The new constitution, which was attributed to the <i>rex</i> Servius Tullius and
followed the Greek model, particularly that of Solon, created a new assembly of
the people, in which <i>populus</i> and plebeians without distinction were included or
excluded according to whether they performed military service or not. The whole
male population liable to bear arms was divided on a property basis into six
classes. The lower limit in each of the five classes was: (1) 100,000 asses;
(2) 75,000 asses; (3) 50,000 asses; (4) 25,000 asses; (5) 11,000 asses;
according to Dureau de la Malle, the equivalent to about 14,000; 10,500; 7,000;
3,600; and 1,570 marks respectively. The sixth class, the proletarians,
consisted of those with less property than the lower class and those exempt
from military service and taxes. In the new popular assembly of the centuries
(<i>comitia centuriata</i>) the citizens appeared in military formation, arranged by
companies in their centuries of a hundred men, each century having one vote.
Now the first class put eighty centuries in the field, the second twenty-two,
the third twenty, the fourth twenty-two, the fifth thirty, and the sixth also
on century for the sake of appearances. In addition, there was the cavalry,
drawn from the wealthiest men, with eighteen centuries; total, 193;
ninety-seven votes were thus required for a clear majority. But the cavalry and
the first class alone had together ninety-eight votes, an therefore the
majority; if they were agreed, they did not ask the others; they made their
decision, and it stood. </p>

<p>This new assembly of the centuries now took over all political rights of the
former assembly of the <i>curiae</i>, with the exception of a few nominal privileges.
The <i>curiae</i> and the gentes of which they were composed were thus degraded, as in
Athens, to mere private and religious associations and continued to vegetate as
such for a long period while the assembly of the <i>curiae</i> soon became completely
dormant. In order that the three old tribes of kinship should also be excluded
from the state, four local tribes were instituted, each of which inhabited one
quarter of the city and possessed a number of political rights. </p>

<p>Thus in Rome also, even before the abolition of the so-called monarchy, the
old order of society based on personal ties of blood was destroyed and in its
place was set up a new and complete state constitution based on territorial
division and difference of wealth. Here the public power consisted of the body
of citizens liable to military service, in opposition not only to the slaves,
but also to those excluded from service in the army and from possession of
arms, the so-called proletarians. </p>

<p>The banishment of the last <i>rex</i>, Tarquinius Superbus, who usurped real
monarchic power, and the replacement of the office of <i>rex</i> by two military
leaders (consuls) with equal powers (as among the Iroquois) was simply a
further development of this new constitution. Within this new constitution, the
whole history of the Roman Republic runs its course, with all the struggles
between patricians and plebeians for admission to office and share in the state
lands, and the final merging of the patrician nobility in the new class of the
great land and money owners, who, gradually swallowing up all the land of the
peasants ruined by military service, employed slave labor to cultivate the
enormous estates thus formed, depopulated Italy and so threw open the door, not
only to the emperors, but also to their successors, the German barbarians. </p>
