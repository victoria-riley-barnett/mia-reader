<h1>VII. The Gens among Celts and Germans</h1>
<hr size="1" width="88%">
<br>


<p class="fst">Space does not allow us to consider the gentile institutions
still existing in greater or lesser degree of purity among the most various
savage and barbarian peoples, nor the traces of these institutions in the
ancient history of the civilized peoples of Asia. The institutions or their
traces are found everywhere. A few examples will be enough. Before the gens had
been recognized, the man who took the greatest pains to misunderstand it,
McLennan himself, proved its existence, and in the main accurately described
it, among the Kalmucks, Circassians, Samoyeds and three Indian peoples: the
Warali, Magars and Munniporees. Recently it has been discovered and described
by M. Kovalevsky among the Pshavs, Shevsurs, Svanets and other Caucasian
tribes. Here we will only give some short notes on the occurrence of the gens
among Celts and Germans. </p>

<p>The oldest Celtic laws which have been preserved show the gens still fully
alive: in Ireland, after being forcibly broken up by the English, it still
lives today in the consciousness of the people, as an instinct at any rate; in
Scotland it was still in full strength in the middle of the eighteenth century,
and here again it succumbed only to the weapons, laws, and courts of the
English. </p>

<p>The old Welsh laws, which were recorded in writing several centuries before
the English conquest, at the latest in the eleventh century, still show common
tillage of the soil by whole villages, even if only as an exceptional relic of
a once general custom; each family had five acres for its own cultivation; a
piece of land was cultivated collectively as well and the yield shared. In view
of the analogy of Ireland and Scotland, it cannot be doubted that these village
communities represent gentes or subdivisions of gentes, even though further
examination of the Welsh laws, which I cannot undertake for lack of time (my
notes date from 1869), should not provide direct proof. But what is directly
proved by the Welsh sources and by the Irish is that among the Celts in the
eleventh century pairing marriage had not by any means been displaced by
monogamy. </p>

<p>In Wales a marriage only became indissoluble, or rather it only ceased to be
terminable by notification, after seven years had elapsed. If the time was
short of seven years by only three nights, husband and wife could separate.
They then shared out their property between them; the woman divided and the man
chose. The furniture was divided according to fixed and very humorous rules. If
it was the man who dissolved the marriage, he had to give the woman back her
dowry and some other things; if it was the woman, she received less. Of the
children the man took two and the woman one, the middle child. If after the
separation the woman took another husband and the first husband came to fetch
her back again, she had to follow him even if she had already one foot in her
new marriage bed. If, on the other hand, the man and woman had been together
for seven years, they were husband and wife, even without any previous formal
marriage. Chastity of girls before marriage was not at all strictly observed,
nor was it demanded; the provisions in this respect are of an extremely
frivolous character and not at all in keeping with bourgeois morality. If a
woman committed adultery, the husband had the right to beat her (this was one
of the three occasions when he was allowed to do so; otherwise he was
punished), but not then to demand any other satisfaction, since &ldquo;for the
one offense there shall be either atonement or vengeance, but not both.&rdquo;
The grounds on which the wife could demand divorce without losing any of her
claims in the subsequent settlement were very comprehensive; if the husband had
bad breath, it was enough. The money which had to be paid to the chief of the
tribe or king to buy off his right of the first night (gobr merch, whence the
medieval name, <i>marcheta</i>; French <i>marquette</i>), plays a large part in the code of
laws. The women had the right to vote in the assemblies of the people. When we
add that the evidence shows similar conditions in Ireland; that there, also,
temporary marriages were quite usual and that at the separation very favorable
and exactly defined conditions were assured to the woman, including even
compensation for her domestic services; that in Ireland there was a
&ldquo;first wife&rdquo; as well as other wives, and that in the division of an
inheritance no distinction was made between children born in wedlock or outside
it &ndash; we then have a picture of pairing marriage in comparison with which the
form of marriage observed in North America appears strict. This is not
surprising in the eleventh century among a people who even so late as
Caesar&rsquo;s time were still living in group marriage. </p>
<a name="1.1"></a> 

<p>The existence of the Irish gens (<i>sept</i>; the tribe was called <i>clainne</i>, clan) is
confirmed and described not only by the old legal codes, but also by the
English jurists of the seventeenth century who were sent over to transform the
clan lands into domains of the English crown. Until then, the land had been the
common property of the clan or gens, in so far as the chieftains had not
already converted it into their private domains. When a member of the gens died
and a household consequently came to an end, the gentile chief (the English
jurists called him <em>caput cognationis</em>) made a new division of the whole
territory among the remaining households. This must have been done, broadly
speaking, according to the rules in force in Germany. Forty or fifty years ago
village fields were very numerous, and even today a few of these rundales, as
they are called, may still be found. The peasants of a rundale, now individual
tenants on the soil that had been the common property of the gens till it was
seized by the English conquerors, pay rent for their respective piece of land,
but put all their shares in arable and meadowland together, which they then
divide according to position and quality into <i>Gewanne</i>, as they are called on
the Moselle, each receiving a share in each <i>Gewann</i>; moorland and pasture-land
are used in common. Only fifty years ago new divisions were still made from
time to time, sometimes annually. The field-map of such a village looks exactly
like that of a German <i>Gehöferschaft</i> [peasant community] on the Moselle or in
the Mittelwald. The gens also lives on in the &ldquo;factions.&rdquo; The Irish
peasants often divide themselves into parties based apparently on perfectly
absurd or meaningless distinctions; to the English they are quite
incomprehensible and seem to have no other purpose than the favorite ceremony
of two factions hammering one another. They are artificial revivals, modern
substitutes for the dispersed gentes, manifesting in their own peculiar manner
the persistence of the inherited gentile instinct. In some districts the
members of the gens still live pretty much together on the old territory; in
the &rsquo;thirties the great majority of the inhabitants of County Monaghan
still had only four family names, that is, they were descended from four gentes
or clans<a name="art">.</a> <span class="note"><a href="#1"><sup
class="enote">[1]</sup></a></span> </p>

<p>In Scotland the decay of the gentile organization dates from the suppression
of the rising of 1745. The precise function of the Scottish clan in this
organization still awaits investigation; but that the clan is a gentile body is
beyond doubt. In Walter Scott's novels the Highland clan lives before our eyes.
It is, says Morgan: </p>

<p class="quote">... an excellent type of the gens in organization and in
spirit, and an extraordinary illustration of the power of the gentile life over
its members ... We find in their feuds and blood revenge, in their localization
by gentes, in their use of lands in common, in the fidelity of the clansman to
his chief and of the members of the clan to each other, the usual and
persistent features of gentile society ... Descent was in the male line, the
children of the males remaining members of the clan, while the children of its
female members belonged to the clans of their respective fathers." </p>

<p class="inline">[Morgan, op. cit., pp. 368-369. &ndash; Ed.] </p>

<p>But that formerly mother-right prevailed in Scotland is proved by the fact
that, according to Bede, in the royal family of the Picts succession was in the
female line. Among the Scots, as among the Welsh, a relic even of the punaluan
family persisted into the Middle Ages in the form of the right of the first
night, which the head of the clan or the king, as last representative of the
former community of husbands, had the right to exercise with every bride,
unless it was compounded for money. </p>
<hr size="1" width="88%">

<p>That the Germans were organized in gentes until the time of the migrations
is beyond all doubt. They can have occupied the territory between the Danube,
Rhine, Vistula, and the northern seas only a few centuries before our era; the
Cimbri and Teutons were then still in full migration, and the Suevi did not
find any permanent habitation until Caesar's time. Caesar expressly states of
them that they had settled in gentes and kindreds (<i>gentibus cognationtbusque</i>),
and in the mouth of a Roman of the Julian gens the word <em>gentibus</em> has a
definite meaning which cannot be argued away. The same was true of all the
Germans; they seem still to have settled by gentes even in the provinces they
conquered from the Romans. The code of laws of the Alemanni confirms that the
people settled by kindreds (<em>genealogiae</em>) in the conquered territory
south of the Danube; <i>genealogia</i> is used in exactly the same sense as
<i>Markgenossenschaft</i> or <i>Dorfgenossenschaft</i> <span class="inote">[Mark or village
community &ndash; Ed.]</span> later. Kovalevsky has recently put forward the
view that these <i>genealogia</i> are the large household communities among which the
land was divided, and from which the village community only developed later.
This would then probably also apply to the <i>fara</i>, with which expression the
Burgundians and the Lombards &ndash; that is, a Gothic and a Herminonian or
High German tribe &ndash; designated nearly, if not exactly, the same thing as
the <i>genealogiae</i> in the Alemannian code of laws. Whether it is really a gens or
a household community must be settled by further research. </p>

<p>The records of language leave us in doubt whether all the Germans had a
common expression for gens, and what that expression was. Etymologically, the
Gothic <i>kuni</i>, Middle High German <b>kunne</b>, corresponds to the Greek <i>genos</i> and the
Latin <i>gens</i>, and is used in the same sense. The fact that the term for woman
comes from the same root &ndash; Greek <i>gyne</i>, Slav <i>zena</i>, Gothic <i>qvino</i>, Old Norse
<i>kona, kuna </i>&ndash; points back to the time of mother-right. Among the Lombards
and Burgundians we find, as already mentioned, the term <i>fara</i>, which Grimm
derives from an imaginary root <i>fisan</i>, to beget. I should prefer to go back to
the more obvious derivation from <i>faran</i> (<i>fahren</i>), to travel or wander; <i>fara</i>
would then denote a section of the migrating people which remained permanently
together and almost as a matter of course would be composed of relatives. In
the several centuries of migration, first to the east and then to the west, the
expression came to be transferred to the kinship group itself. There are,
further, the Gothic <i>sibia</i>, Anglo-Saxon <i>sib</i>, Old High German <i>sippia, sima</i>,
kindred. Old Norse only has the plural <i>sifiar</i>, relatives; the singular only
occurs as the name of a goddess, <i>Sif</i>. Lastly, still another expression occurs
in the <i>Hildebrandslied</i>, where Hildebrand asks Hadubrand: &ldquo;Who is thy
father among the men of the people ... or of what kin art thou?&ldquo; (<i>eddo huêlîhes cnuosles du sîs</i>). In as far as there was a common German name for the
gens, it was probably the Gothic <i>kuni</i> that was used; this is rendered probable,
not only by its identity with the corresponding expression in the related
languages, but also by the fact that from it is derived the word <i>kuning, König</i>
(king), which originally denotes the head of a gens or of a tribe. <i>Sibia</i>,
kindred, does not seem to call for consideration; at any rate, <i>sifiar</i> in Old
Norse denotes not only blood relations, but also relations by marriage; thus it
includes the members of at least <i>two</i> gentes, and hence <i>sif</i> itself cannot have
been the term for the gens. </p>

<p>As among the Mexicans and Greeks, so also among the Germans, the order of
battle, both the cavalry squadrons and the wedge formations of the infantry,
was drawn up by gentes. Tacitus&rsquo; use of the vague expression &ldquo;by
families and kindreds&rdquo; is to be explained through the fact that in his
time the gens in Rome had long ceased to be a living body. </p>
<a name="2.1"></a> 

<p>A further passage in Tacitus is decisive. It states that the maternal uncle
looks upon his nephew as his own son, and that some even regard the bond of
blood between the maternal uncle and the nephew as more sacred and close than
that between father and son, so that when hostages are demanded the sister's
son is considered a better security than the natural son of the man whom it is
desired to bind. Here we have living evidence, described as particularly
characteristic of the Germans, of the matriarchal, and therefore primitive,
gens. <span class="note"><a href="#2"><sup class="enote">[2]</sup></a></span>
If a member of such a gens gave his own son as a pledge of his oath and the son
then paid the penalty of death for his father's breach of faith, the father had
to answer for that to himself. But if it was a sister's son who was sacrificed,
then the most sacred law of the gens was violated. The member of the gens who
was nearest of kin to the boy or youth, and more than all others was bound to
protect him, was guilty of his death; either he should not have pledged him or
he should have kept the agreement. Even if we had no other trace of gentile
organization among the Germans, this one passage would suffice. </p>

<p>Still more decisive, because it comes about eight hundred years later, is a
passage from the Old Norse poem of the twilight of the gods and the end of the
world, the <i>Völuspà</i>. In this "vision of the seeress," into which Christian
elements are also interwoven, as Bang and Bugge have now proved, the
description of the period of universal degeneration and corruption leading up
to the great catastrophe contains the following passage: </p>

<p class="quoteb">Broedhr munu berjask ok at bonum verdask,<br>
munu systrungar sifjum spilla. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Brothers will make war upon one another and become one
another&rsquo;s murderers, <i>the children of sisters</i> will break kinship.&rdquo;
<em>Systrungar</em> means the son of the mother&rsquo;s sister, and that these
sisters&rsquo; sons should betray the blood-bond between them is regarded by
the poet as an even greater crime than that of fratricide. The force of the
climax is in the word <i>systrungar</i>, which emphasizes the kinship on the
mother&ldquo;s side; if the word had been <i>syskina-börn</i>, brothers' or sisters'
children, or <i>syskinasynir</i>, brothers' or sisters' sons, the second line would
not have been a climax to the first, but would merely have weakened the effect.
Hence even in the time of the Vikings, when the <i>Völuspà</i> was composed, the
memory of mother-right had not yet been obliterated in Scandinavia. </p>

<p>In the time of Tacitus, however, mother-right had already given way to
father-right, at least among the Germans with whose customs he was more
familiar. The children inherited from the father; if there were no children,
the brothers, and the uncles on the father's and the mother's side. The fact
that the mother&rsquo;s brother was allowed to inherit is connected with the
survivals of mother-right already mentioned, and again proves how new
father-right still was among the Germans at that time. Traces of mother-right
are also found until late in the Middle Ages. Apparently even at that time
people still did not have any great trust in fatherhood, especially in the case
of serfs. When, therefore, a feudal lord demanded from a town the return of a
fugitive serf, it was required &ndash; for example, in Augsburg, Basle and
Kaiserslautern &ndash; that the accused person's status as serf should be sworn
to by six of his nearest blood relations, and that they should all be relations
on the mother&rsquo;s side. (Maurer, <em>Städteverfassung</em>, I, p. 381.) </p>

<p>Another relic of mother-right, which was still only in process of dying out,
was the respect of the Germans for the female sex, which to the Romans was
almost incomprehensible. Young girls of noble family were considered the most
binding hostages in treaties with the Germans. The thought that their wives and
daughters might be taken captive and carried into slavery was terrible to them
and more than anything else fired their courage in battle; they saw in a woman
something holy and prophetic, and listened to her advice even in the most
important matters. Veleda, the priestess of the Bructerians on the River Lippe,
was the very soul of the whole Batavian rising in which Civilis, at the head of
the Germans and Belgae, shook the foundations of Roman rule in Gaul. In the
home, the woman seems to have held undisputed sway, though, together with the
old people and the children, she also had to do all the work, while the man
hunted, drank, or idled about. That, at least, is what Tacitus says; but as he
does not say who tilled the fields, and definitely declares that the serfs only
paid tribute, but did not have to render labor dues, the bulk of the adult men
must have had to do what little work the cultivation of the land required. The
form of marriage, as already said, was a pairing marriage which was gradually
approaching monogamy. It was not yet strict monogamy, as polygamy was permitted
for the leading members of the tribe. In general, strict chastity was required
of the girls (in contrast to the Celts), and Tacitus also speaks with special
warmth of the sacredness of the marriage tie among the Germans. Adultery by the
woman is the only ground for divorce mentioned by him. But there are many gaps
here in his report, and it is also only too apparent that he is holding up a
mirror of virtue before the dissipated Romans. One thing is certain: if the
Germans were such paragons of virtue in their forests, it only required slight
contact with the outside world to bring them down to the level of the average
man in the rest of Europe. Amidst the Roman world, the last trace of moral
austerity disappeared far more rapidly even than the German language. For
proof, it is enough to read Gregory of Tours. That in the German primeval
forests there could be no such voluptuous abandonment to all the refinements of
sensuality as in Rome is obvious; the superiority of the Germans to the Roman
world in this respect also is sufficiently great, and there is no need to endow
them with an ideal continence in things of the flesh, such as has never yet
been practiced by an entire nation. </p>

<p>Also derived from the gentile organization is the obligation to inherit the
enmities as well as the friendships of the father or the relatives; likewise
the <em>Wergeld</em>, the fine for idling or injuring, in place of blood
revenge. The <i>Wergeld</i>, which only a generation ago was regarded as a
specifically German institution, has now been shown to be general among
hundreds of peoples as a milder form of the blood revenge originating out of
the gentile organization. We find it, for example, among the American Indians,
who also regard hospitality as an obligation. Tacitus&rsquo; description of
hospitality as practiced among the Germans (<i>Germania</i>, Ch. XXI) is identical
almost to the details with that given by Morgan of his Indians. </p>

<p>The endless, burning controversy as to whether the Germans of Tacitus&rsquo;
time had already definitely divided the land or not, and how the relevant
passages are to be interpreted, now belongs to the past. No more words need be
wasted in this dispute, since it has been established that among almost all
peoples the cultivated land was tilled collectively by the gens, and later by
communistic household communities such as were still found by Caesar among the
Suevi, and that after this stage the land was allotted to individual families
with periodical repartitions, which are shown to have survived as a local
custom in Germany down to our day. If in the one hundred and fifty years
between Caesar and Tacitus the Germans had changed from the collective
cultivation of the land expressly attributed by Caesar to the Suevi (they had
no divided or private fields whatever, he says) to individual cultivation with
annual repartition of the land, that is surely progress enough. The transition
from that stage to complete private property in land during such a short period
and without any outside interference is a sheer impossibility. What I read in
Tacitus is simply what he says in his own dry words: they change (or divide
afresh) the cultivated land every year, and there is enough common land left
over. It is the stage of agriculture and property relations in regard to the
land which exactly corresponds to the gentile constitution of the Germans at
that time. </p>

<p>I leave the preceding paragraph unchanged as it stood in the former
editions. Meanwhile the question has taken another turn. Since Kovalevsky has
shown (cf. pages 51-52) that the patriarchal household community was a very
common, if not universal, intermediate form between the matriarchal communistic
family and the modern isolated family, it is no longer a question of whether
property in land is communal or private, which was the point at issue between
Maurer and Waitz, but a question of the <i>form</i> of the communal property. There is
no doubt at all that the Suevi in Caesar's time not only owned the land in
common, but also cultivated it in common for the common benefit. Whether the
economic unit was the gens or the household community or a communistic kinship
group intermediate between the two; or whether all three groups occurred
according to the conditions of the soil &ndash; these questions will be in
dispute for a long time to come. Kovalevsky maintains, however, that the
conditions described by Tacitus presuppose the existence, not of the mark or
village community, but of the household community and that the village
community only develops out of the latter much later, as a result of the
increase in population. </p>

<p>According to this view, the settlements of the Germans in the territory of
which they were already in possession at the time of the Romans, and also in
the territory which they later took from the Romans, were not composed of
villages but of large household communities, which included several
generations, cultivated an amount of land proportionate to the number of their
members, and had common use with their neighbors of the surrounding waste. The
passage in Tacitus about changing the cultivated land would then have to be
taken in an agronomic sense: the community cultivated a different piece of land
every year, and allowed the land cultivated the previous year to lie fallow or
run completely to waste; the population being scanty, there was always enough
waste left over to make any disputes about land unnecessary. Only in the course
of centuries, when the number of members in the household communities had
increased so much that a common economy was no longer possible under the
existing conditions of production did the communities dissolve. The arable and
meadow lands which had hitherto been common were divided in the manner familiar
to us, first temporarily and then permanently, among the single households
which were now coming into being, while forest, pasture land, and water
remained common. </p>

<p>In the case of Russia this development seems to be a proved historical fact.
With regard to Germany, and, secondarily, the other Germanic countries, it
cannot be denied that in many ways this view provides a better explanation of
the sources and an easier solution to difficulties than that held hitherto,
which takes the village community back to the time of Tacitus. On the whole,
the oldest documents, such as the <i>Codex Laureshamensis</i>, can be explained much
better in terms of the household community than of the village community. On
the other hand, this view raises new difficulties and new questions, which have
still to be solved. They can only be settled by new investigations; but I
cannot deny that in the case also of Germany, Scandinavia and England there is
very great probability in favor of the intermediate form of the household
community. </p>

<p>While in Caesar&rsquo;s time the Germans had only just taken up or were
still looking for settled abodes, in Tacitus&rsquo; time they already had a
full century of settled life behind them; correspondingly, the progress in the
production of the necessities of life is unmistakable. They live in log-houses;
their clothing is still very much that of primitive people of the forests:
coarse woolen mantles, skins; for women and notable people underclothing of
linen. Their food is milk, meat, wild fruits, and, as Pliny adds, oatmeal
porridge (still the Celtic national food in Ireland and Scotland). Their wealth
consists in cattle and horses, but of inferior breed; the cows are small, poor
in build and without horns; the horses are ponies, with very little speed.
Money was used rarely and in small amounts; it was exclusively Roman. They did
not work gold or silver, nor did they value it. Iron was rare, and, at least,
among the tribes on the Rhine and the Danube, seems to have been almost
entirely imported, not mined. Runic writing (imitated from the Greek or Latin
letters) was a purely secret form of writing, used only for religious magic.
Human sacrifices were still offered. In short, we here see a people which had
just raised itself from the middle to the upper stage of barbarism. But whereas
the tribes living immediately on the Roman frontiers were hindered in the
development of an independent metal and textile industry by the facility with
which Roman products could be imported, such industry undoubtedly did develop
in the northeast, on the Baltic. The fragments of weapons found in the
Schleswig marshes &ndash; long iron sword, coat of mail, silver helmet, and so
forth, together with Roman coins of the end of the second century &ndash; and
the German metal objects distributed by the migrations, show quite a pronounced
character of their own, even when they derive from an originally Roman model.
Emigration into the civilized Roman world put an end to this native industry
everywhere except in England. With what uniformity this industry arose and
developed, can be seen, for example, in the bronze brooches; those found in
Burgundy, Rumania and on the Sea of Azov might have come out of the same
workshop as those found in England and Sweden, and are just as certainly of
Germanic origin. </p>

<p>The constitution also corresponds to the upper stage of barbarism. According
to Tacitus, there was generally a council of chiefs (<em>principes</em>), which
decided minor matters, but prepared more important questions for decision by
the assembly of the people; at the lower stage of barbarism, so far as we have
knowledge of it, as among the Americans, this assembly of the people still
comprises only the members of the gens, not yet of the tribe or of the
confederacy of tribes. The chiefs (<em>principes</em>) are still sharply
distinguished from the military leaders (<em>duces</em>) just as they are among
the Iroquois; they already subsist partially on gifts of cattle, corn, etc.,
from the members of the tribe; as in America, they are generally elected from
the same family. The transition to father-right favored, as in Greece and Rome,
the gradual transformation of election into hereditary succession, and hence
the rise of a noble family in each gens. This old so-called tribal nobility
disappeared for the most part during the migrations or soon afterwards. The
military leaders were chosen without regard to their descent, solely according
to their ability. They had little power and had to rely on the force of
example. Tacitus expressly states that the actual disciplinary authority in the
army lay with the priests. The real power was in the hands of the assembly of
the people. The king or the chief of the tribe presides; the people decide:
&ldquo;No&rdquo; by murmurs; &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; by acclamation and clash of
weapons. The assembly of the people is at the same time an assembly of justice;
here complaints are brought forward and decided and sentences of death passed,
the only capital crimes being cowardice, treason against the people, and
unnatural lust. Also in the gentes and other subdivisions of the tribe all the
members sit in judgment under the presidency of the chief, who, as in all the
early German courts, can only have guided the proceedings and put questions;
the actual verdict was always given among Germans everywhere by the whole
community. </p>

<p>Confederacies of tribes had grown up since the time of Caesar; some of them
already had kings; the supreme military commander was already aiming at the
position of tyrant, as among the Greeks and Romans, and sometimes secured it.
But these fortunate usurpers were not by any means absolute rulers; they were,
however, already beginning to break the fetters of the gentile constitution.
Whereas freed slaves usually occupied a subordinate position, since they could
not belong to any gens, as favorites of the new kings they often won rank,
riches and honors. The same thing happened after the conquest of the Roman
Empire by these military leaders, who now became kings of great countries.
Among the Franks, slaves and freedmen of the king played a leading part first
at the court and then in the state; the new nobility was to a great extent
descended from them. </p>

<p>One institution particularly favored the rise of kingship: the retinues. We
have already seen among the American Indians how, side by side with the gentile
constitution, private associations were formed to carry on wars independently.
Among the Germans, these private associations had already become permanent. A
military leader who had made himself a name gathered around him a band of young
men eager for booty, whom he pledged to personal loyalty, giving the same
pledge to them. The leader provided their keep, gave them gifts, and organized
them on a hierarchic basis; a bodyguard and a standing troop for smaller
expeditions and a regular corps of officers for operations on a larger scale.
Weak as these retinues must have been, and as we in fact find them to be later
&ndash; for example, under Odoacer in Italy &ndash; they were nevertheless the
beginnings of the decay of the old freedom of the people and showed themselves
to be such during and after the migrations. For in the first place they favored
the rise of monarchic power. In the second place, as Tacitus already notes,
they could only be kept together by continual wars and plundering expeditions.
Plunder became an end in itself. If the leader of the retinue found nothing to
do in the neighborhood, he set out with his men to other peoples where there
was war and the prospect of booty. The German mercenaries who fought in great
numbers under the Roman standard even against Germans were partly mobilized
through these retinues. They already represent the first form of the system of
<i>Landsknechte</i>, the shame and curse of the Germans. When the Roman Empire had
been conquered, these retinues of the kings formed the second main stock, after
the unfree and the Roman courtiers, from which the later nobility was drawn.
</p>

<p>In general, then, the constitution of those German tribes which had combined
into peoples was the same as had developed among the Greeks of the Heroic Age
and the Romans of the so-called time of the kings: assembly of the people,
council of the chiefs of the gentes, military leader, who is already striving
for real monarchic power. It was the highest form of constitution which the
gentile order could achieve; it was the model constitution of the upper stage
of barbarism. If society passed beyond the limits within which this
constitution was adequate, that meant the end of the gentile order; it was
broken up and the state took its place. </p>

<p class="fst"><strong><a href="#1.1">[1]</a></strong> During a few days spent
in Ireland, I realized afresh to what an extent the country people still live
in the conceptions of the gentile period. The landed proprietor, whose tenant
the farmer is, is still regarded by the latter as a kind of chief of the clan,
whose duty it is to manage the land in the interests of all, while the farmer
pays tribute in the form of rent, but has a claim upon him for assistance in
times of necessity. Similarly, everyone who is well off is considered under an
obligation to assist his poorer neighbors when they fall on hard times. Such
help is not charity; it is what the poorer member of the clan is entitled to
receive from the wealthier member or the chief. One can understand the
complaints of the political economists and jurists about the impossibility of
making the Irish peasant grasp the idea of modern bourgeois property; the
Irishman simply cannot get it into his head that there can be property with
rights but no duties. But one can also understand that when Irishmen with these
naive gentile conceptions suddenly find themselves in one of the big English or
American towns among a population with completely different ideas of morality
and justice, they easily become completely confused about both morality and
justice and lose all their bearings, with the result that masses of them become
demoralized. (Note to the Fourth Edition.) </p>

<p class="fst"><strong><a href="#2.1">[2]</a></strong> The peculiar closeness
of the bond between maternal uncle and nephew, which derives from the time of
mother-right and is found among many peoples, is only recognized by the Greeks
in their mythology of the heroic age. According to Diodorus, IV, 34, Meleager
slays the sons of Thestius, the brothers of his mother Althma. She regards this
deed as such an inexpiable crime that she curses the murderer, her own son, and
prays for his death. &ldquo;The gods heard her wishes,&rdquo; the story says, &ldquo;and put an
end to Meleager&rsquo;s life.&rdquo; Also according to Diodorus (IV, 44), the Argonauts
land in Thrace under Heracles and there find that Phincus, at the instigation
of his new wife, is shamefully ill-treating the two sons born to him by his
former wife, the Boread Cleopatra, whom he has put away. But among the
Argonauts there are also Boreads, brothers of Cleopatra, therefore maternal
uncles of the maltreated boys. They at once take up their nephews&rsquo; cause, free
them, and kill their guards. </p>
