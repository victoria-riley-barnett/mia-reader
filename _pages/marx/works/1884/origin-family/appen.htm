<P class="fst"><SPAN class="cap">S</SPAN>ince it has recently become fashionable among certain rationalistic
ethnographers to deny the existence of group marriage, the following
report is of interest; I translate it from the <i>Russkiye Vyedomosti</i>,
Moscow, October 14, 1892 (Old Style).  Not only group marriage, i.e.,
the right of mutual sexual intercourse between a number of men and a
number of women, is expressly affirmed to be in full force, but a form
of group marriage which closely follows the punaluan marriage of the
Hawaiians, the most developed and classic phase of group marriage. 
While the typical punaluan family consists of a number of brothers (own
and collateral), who are married to a number of own and collateral
sisters, we here find on the island of Sakhalin that a man is married
to all the wives of his brothers and to all the sisters of his wife,
which means, seen from the woman's side, that his wife may freely
practice sexual intercourse with the brothers of her husband and the
husbands of her sisters.  It therefore differs from the typical form of
punaluan marriage only in the fact that the brothers of the husband and
the husbands of the sisters are not necessarily the same persons.
</P>

<P>
It should further be observed that this report again confirms what I
said in <i>The Origin of the Family</i>, 4th edition, pp. 28-29: that group
marriage does not look at all like what our brother-obsessed philistine
imagines; that the partners in group marriage do not lead in public the
same kind of lascivious life as he practices in secret, but that this
form of marriage, at least in the instances still known to occur today,
differs in practice from a loose pairing marriage or from polygamy only
in the fact that custom permits sexual intercourse in a number of cases
where otherwise it would be severely punished.  That the actual
exercise of these rights is gradually dying out only proves that this
form of marriage is itself destined to die out, which is further
confirmed by its infrequency.
</P>

<P>
The whole description, moreover, is interesting because it again
demonstrates the similarity, even the identity in their main
characteristics, of the social institutions of primitive peoples at
approximately the same stage of development.  Most of what the report
states about these Mongoloids on the island of Sakhalin also holds for
the Dravidian tribes of India, the South Sea Islanders at the time of
their discovery, and the American Indians.  The report runs:

     "At the session of October 10 (Old Style; October 22, New Style)
     of the Anthropological Section of the Society of the Friends of
     Natural Science, N. A. Yanchuk read an interesting communication
     from Mr. Sternberg on the Gilyaks, a little-studied tribe on the
     island of Sakhalin, who are at the cultural level of savagery. 
     The Gilyaks are acquainted neither with agriculture nor with
     pottery; they procure their food chiefly by hunting and fishing;
     they warm water in wooden vessels by throwing in heated stones,
     etc.  Of particular interest are their institutions relating to
     the family and to the gens. The Gilyak addresses as father, not
     only his own natural father, but also all the brothers of his
     father; all the wives of these brothers, as well as all the
     sisters of his mother, he addresses as his mothers; the children
     of all these 'fathers' and 'mothers' he addresses as his brothers
     and sisters. This system of address also exists, as is well known,
     among the Iroquois and other Indian tribes of North America, as
     also among some tribes of India.  But whereas in these cases it
     has long since ceased to correspond to the actual conditions,
     among the Gilyaks it serves to designate <i>a state still valid
     today</i>.  To this day <i>every Gilyak has the rights of a husband in
     regard to the wives of his brothers and to the sisters of his
     wife</i>; at any rate, the exercise of these rights is not regarded as
     impermissible.  These survivals of group marriage on the basis of
     the gens are reminiscent of the well-known punaluan marriage,
     which still existed in the Sandwich Islands in the first half of
     this century.  Family and gens relations of this type form the
     basis of the whole gentile order and social constitution of the
     Gilyaks.
</P>

<P class="quote">
     "The gens of a Gilyak consists of all-nearer and more remote, real
     and nominal-brothers of his father, of their fathers and mothers
     of the children of his brothers, and of his own children.
</P>

<P>
One can readily understand that a gens so constituted may comprise an
enormous number of people.  Life within the gens proceeds according to
the following principles.  Marriage within the gens is unconditionally
prohibited.  When a Gilyak dies, his wife passes by decision of the
gens to one of his brothers, own or nominal.  The gens provides for the
maintenance of all of its members who are unable to work.  'We have no
poor,' said a Gilyak to the writer.  'Whoever is in need, is fed by the
<i>khal</i> [gens].' The members of the gens are further united by common
sacrificial ceremonies and festivals, a common burial place, etc.
</P>

<P class="quote">
"The gens guarantees the life and security of its members against
attacks by non-gentiles; the means of repression used is blood-revenge,
though under Russian rule the practice has very much declined.  Women
are completely excepted from gentile blood-revenge.  In some very rare
cases the gens adopts members of other gentes.  It is a general rule
that the property of a deceased member may not pass out of the gens; in
this respect the famous provision of the Twelve Tables holds literally
among the Gilyaks: <i>si suos heredes non habet, gentiles familiam habento</i>
&ndash; if he has no heirs of his own, the members of the gens shall
inherit.  No important event takes place in the life of a Gilyak
without participation by the gens.  Not very long ago, about one or two
generations, the oldest gentile member was the head of the community,
the <i>starosta</i> of the gens; today the functions of the chief elder of the
gens are restricted almost solely to presiding over religious
ceremonies.  The gentes are often dispersed among widely distant
places, but even when separated the members of a gens still remember
one another and continue to give one another hospitality, and to
provide mutual assistance and protection, etc.  Except under the most
extreme necessity, the Gilyak never leaves the fellow-members of his
gens or the graves of his gens.  Gentile society has impressed a very
definite stamp on the whole mental life of the Gilyaks, on their
character, their customs and institutions.  The habit of common
discussion and decision on all matters, the necessity of continually
taking an active part in all questions affecting the members of the
gens, the solidarity of blood-revenge, the fact of being compelled and
accustomed to live together with ten or more like himself in great
tents (<i>yurtas</i>), and to be, in short, always with other people-all this
has given the Gilyak a sociable and open character.  The Gilyak is
extraordinarily hospitable; he loves to entertain guests and to come
himself as a guest.  This admirable habit of hospitality is especially
prominent in times of distress.  In a bad year, when a Gilyak has
nothing for himself or for his dogs to eat, he does not stretch out his
hand for alms, but confidently seeks hospitality, and is fed, often for
a considerable time.

<P class="quote">
     "Among the Gilyaks of Sakhalin crimes from motives of personal
     gain practically never occur.  The Gilyak keeps his valuables in a
     storehouse, which is never locked.  He has such a keen sense of
     shame that if he is convicted of a disgraceful act, he immediately
     goes into the forest and hangs himself.  Murder is very rare, and
     is hardly ever committed except in anger, never from intentions of
     gain.  In his dealings with other people, the Gilyak shows himself
     honest, reliable, and conscientious.
</P>

<P class="quote">
     "Despite their long subjection to the Manchurians, now become
     Chinese, and despite the corrupting influence of the settlement of
     the Amur district, the Gilyaks still preserve in their moral
     character many of the virtues of a primitive tribe.  But the fate
     awaiting their social order cannot be averted.  One or two more
     generations, and the Gilyaks on the mainland will have been
     completely Russianized, and together with the benefits of culture
     they will also acquire its defects.  The Gilyaks on the island of
     Sakhalin, being more or less remote from the centers of Russian
     settlement, have some prospect of preserving their way of life
     unspoiled rather longer.  But among them, too, the influence of
     their Russian neighbors is beginning to make itself felt.  The
     Gilyaks come into the villages to trade, they go to Nikolaievsk to
     look for work; and every Gilyak who returns from such work to his
     home brings with him the same atmosphere which the Russian worker
     takes back from the town into his village.  And at the same time,
     working in the town, with its chances and changes of fortune,
     destroys more and more that primitive equality which is such a
     prominent feature of the artlessly simple economic life of these
     peoples.
