<p class="fst">We now come to another discovery made by Morgan, which is at
least as important as the reconstruction of the family in its primitive form
from the systems of consanguinity. The proof that the kinship organizations
designated by animal names in a tribe of American Indians are essentially
identical with the <i>genea</i> of the Greeks and the <i>gentes</i> of the Romans; that the
American is the original form and the Greek and Roman forms are later and
derivative; that the whole social organization of the primitive Greeks and
Romans into gens, phratry, and tribe finds its faithful parallel in that of the
American Indians; that the gens is an institution common to all barbarians
until their entry into civilization and even afterwards (so far as our sources
go up to the present) &ndash; this proof has cleared up at one stroke the most
difficult questions in the most ancient periods of Greek and Roman history,
providing us at the same time with an unsuspected wealth of information about
the fundamental features of social constitution in primitive times &ndash;
before the introduction of the <i>state</i>. Simple as the matter seems once it is
understood, Morgan only made his discovery quite recently. In his previous
work, published in 1871, <span class="note"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span> he had
not yet penetrated this secret, at whose subsequent revelation the English
anthropologists, usually so self-confident, became for a time as quiet as mice.
</p>
<a name="2.1"></a> 

<p>The Latin word <i>gens</i>, which Morgan uses as a general term for such kinship
organizations, comes, like its Greek equivalent, <i>genos</i>, from the common Aryan
root <i>gan</i> (in German, where, following the law <span class="note"><a
href="#2">[2]</a></span> Aryan <i>g</i> is regularly replaced by <i>k, kan</i>), which means
to beget. <i>Gens, Genos</i>, Sanscrit <i>jánas</i>, Gothic <i>kuni</i> (following the same law as
above), Old Norse and Anglo-Saxon <i>kyn</i>, English <i>kin</i>, Middle High German <i>künne</i>,
all signify lineage, descent. <i>Gens</i> in Latin and <i>genos</i> in Greek are, however,
used specifically to denote the form of kinship organization which prides
itself on its common descent (in this case from a common ancestral father) and
is bound together by social and religious institutions into a distinct
community, though to all our historians its origin and character have hitherto
remained obscure. </p>

<p>We have already seen, in connection with the punaluan family, what is the composition of a
gens in its original form. It consists of all the persons who in punaluan
marriage, according to the conceptions necessarily prevailing under it, form
the recognized descendants of one particular ancestral mother, the founder of
the gens. In this form of family, as paternity is uncertain, only the female
line counts. Since brothers may not marry their sisters but only women of
different descent, the children begotten by them with these alien women cannot,
according to mother-right, belong to the father's gens. Therefore only the
offspring of the <i>daughters</i> in each generation remain within the kinship
organization; the offspring of the sons go into the gentes of their mothers.
What becomes of this consanguine group when it has constituted itself a
separate group, distinct from similar groups within the tribe? </p>

<p>As the classic form of this original gens, Morgan takes the gens among the
Iroquois, and especially in the Seneca tribe. In this tribe there are eight
gentes, named after animals: (1) Wolf, (2) Bear, (3) Turtle, (4) Beaver, (5)
Deer, (6) Snipe, (7) Heron, (8) Hawk. In every gens the following customs are
observed: </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">1. The gens elects its sachem
(head of the gens in peace) and its chief (leader in war). The sachem had to be
chosen from among the members of the gens, and his office was hereditary within
the gens, in the sense that it had to be filled immediately as often as a
vacancy occurred; the military leader could be chosen from outside the gens,
and for a time the office might even be vacant. A son was never chosen to
succeed his father as sachem, since mother-right prevailed among the Iroquois
and the son consequently belonged to a different gens; but the office might and
often did pass to a brother of the previous sachem or to his sister's son. All
voted in the elections, both men and women. The election, however, still
required the confirmation of the seven remaining gentes, and only then was the
new sachem ceremonially invested with his office by the common council of the
whole Iroquois confederacy. The significance of this will appear later. The
authority of the sachem within the gens was paternal, and purely moral in
character; he had no means of coercion. By virtue of his office he was also a
member of the tribal council of the Senecas and also of the federal council of
all the Iroquois. The war-chief could only give orders on military expeditions.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">2. The gens deposes the sachem
and war-chief at will. This also is done by men and women jointly. After a
sachem or chief had been deposed, they became simple braves, private persons,
like the other members. The tribal council also had the power to depose
sachems, even against the will of the gens. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">3. No member is permitted to
marry within the gens. This is the fundamental law of the gens, the bond which
holds it together. It is the negative expression of the very positive blood
relationship, by virtue of which the individuals it comprises become a gens. By
his discovery of this simple fact Morgan has revealed for the first time the
nature of the gens. How little the gens was understood before is obvious from
the earlier reports about savages and barbarians, in which the various bodies
out of which the gentile organization is composed are ignorantly and
indiscriminately referred to as tribe, clan, <i>thum</i>, and so forth, and then
sometimes designated as bodies within which marriage is prohibited. Thus was
created the hopeless confusion which gave Mr. McLennan his chance to appear as
Napoleon, establishing order by his decree: All tribes are divided into those
within which marriage is prohibited (exogamous) and those within which it is
permitted (endogamous). Having now made the muddle complete, he could give
himself up to the profoundest inquiries as to which of his two absurd classes
was the older exogamy or endogamy. All this nonsense promptly stopped of itself
with the discovery of the gens and of its basis in consanguinity, involving the
exclusion of its members from intermarriage with one another. It goes without
saying that at the stage at which we find the Iroquois the prohibition of
marriage within the gens was stringently observed. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">4. The property of deceased
persons passed to the other members of the gens; it had to remain in the gens.
As an Iroquois had only things of little value to leave, the inheritance was
shared by his nearest gentile relations; in the case of a man, by his own
brothers and sisters and maternal uncle; in the case of a woman, by her
children and own sisters, but not by her brothers. For this reason man and wife
could not inherit from one another, nor children from their father. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">5. The members of the gens owed
each other help, protection, and especially assistance in avenging injury by
strangers. The individual looked for his security to the protection of the
gens, and could rely upon receiving it; to wrong him was to wrong his whole
gens. From the bonds of blood uniting the gens sprang the obligation of blood
revenge, which the Iroquois unconditionally recognized. If any person from
outside the gens killed a gentile member, the obligation of blood revenge
rested on the entire gens of the slain man. First, mediation was tried; the
gens of the slayer sat in council, and made proposals of settlement to the
council of the gens of the slain, usually offering expressions of regret and
presents of considerable value. If these were accepted, the matter was disposed
of. In the contrary case, the wronged gens appointed one or more avengers,
whose duty it was to pursue and kill the slayer. If this was accomplished, the
gens of the slayer had no ground of complaint; accounts were even and closed.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">6. The gens has special names or
classes of names, which may not be used by any other gens in the whole tribe,
so that the name of the individual indicates the gens to which he belongs. A
gentile name confers of itself gentile rights. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">7. The gens can adopt strangers
and thereby admit them into the whole tribe. Thus among the Senecas the
prisoners of war who were not killed became through adoption into a gens
members of the tribe, receiving full gentile and tribal rights. The adoption
took place on the proposal of individual members of the gens; if a man adopted,
he accepted the stranger as brother or sister; if a woman, as son or daughter.
The adoption had to be confirmed by ceremonial acceptance into the tribe.
Frequently a gens which was exceptionally reduced in numbers was replenished by
mass adoption from another gens, with its consent. Among the Iroquois the
ceremony of adoption into the gens was performed at a public council of the
tribe, and therefore was actually a religious rite. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">8. Special religious ceremonies
can hardly be found among the Indian gentes; the religious rites of the Indians
are, however, more or less connected with the gens. At the six yearly religious
festivals of the Iroquois the sachems and war-chiefs of the different gentes
were included ex officio among the &ldquo;Keepers of the Faith&rdquo; and had
priestly functions. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">9. The gens has a common burial
place. Among the Iroquois of New York State, who are hedged in on all sides by
white people, this has disappeared, but it existed formerly. It exists still
among other Indians &ndash; for example, among the Tuscaroras, who are closely
related to the Iroquois; although they are Christians, each gens has a separate
row in the cemetery; the mother is therefore buried in the same row as her
children, but not the father. And among the Iroquois also the whole gens of the
deceased attends the burial, prepares the grave, the funeral addresses, etc.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">10. The gens has a council: the
democratic assembly of all male and female adult gentiles, all with equal
votes. This council elected sachems, war-chiefs and also the other "Keepers of
the Faith," and deposed them; it took decisions regarding blood revenge or
payment of atonement for murdered gentiles; it adopted strangers into the gens.
In short, it was the sovereign power in the gens. Such were the rights and
privileges of a typical Indian gens. </p>
<a name="3.1"></a> 

<p class="indent">All the members of an Iroquois gens were personally free, and
they were bound to defend each other's freedom; they were equal in privileges
and in personal rights, the sachem and chiefs claiming no superiority; and they
were a brotherhood bound together by the ties of kin. Liberty, equality, and
fraternity, though never formulated, were cardinal principles of the gens.
These facts are material, because the gens was the unit of a social and
governmental system, the foundation upon which Indian society was organized ...
It serves to explain that sense of independence and personal dignity
universally an attribute of Indian character. <span class="note"><a
href="#3">[3]</a></span> </p>

<p>The Indians of the whole of North America at the time of its discovery were
organized in gentes under mother-right. The gentes had disappeared only in some
tribes, as among the Dakotas; in others, as among the Ojibwas and the Omahas,
they were organized according to father-right. </p>

<p>Among very many Indian tribes with more than five or six gentes, we find
every three, four, or more gentes united in a special group, which Morgan,
rendering the Indian name faithfully by its Greek equivalent, calls a "phratry"
(brotherhood). Thus the Senecas have two phratries: the first comprises gentes
1 to 4, the second gentes 5 to 8. Closer investigation shows that these
phratries generally represent the original gentes into which the tribe first
split up; for since marriage was prohibited within the gens, there had to be at
least two gentes in any tribe to enable it to exist independently. </p>

<p>In the measure in which the tribe increased, each gens divided again into
two or more gentes, each of which now appears as a separate gens, while the
original gens, which includes all the daughter gentes, continues as the
phratry. Among the Senecas and most other Indians, the gentes within one
phratry are brother gentes to one another, while those in the other phratry are
their cousin gentes-terms which in the American system of consanguinity have,
as we have seen, a very real and expressive meaning. Originally no Seneca was
allowed to marry within his phratry, but this restriction has long since become
obsolete and is now confined to the gens. According to Senecan tradition, the
Bear and the Deer were the two original gentes, from which the others branched
off. After this new institution had once taken firm root, it was modified as
required; if the gentes in one phratry died out, entire gentes were sometimes
transferred into it from other phratries to make the numbers even. Hence we
find gentes of the same name grouped in different phratries in different
tribes. </p>

<p>Among the Iroquois, the functions of the phratry are partly social, partly
religious. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -25px;">(1) In the ball game one phratry
plays against another. Each phratry puts forward its best players, while the
other members, grouped according to phratries, look on and bet against one
another on the victory of their players. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -25px;">(2) In the tribal council the
sachems and the war-chiefs of each phratry sit together, the two groups facing
one another; each speaker addresses the representatives of each phratry as a
separate body. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -25px;">(3) If a murder had been
committed in the tribe, and the slayer and the slain belonged to different
phratries, the injured gens often appealed to its brother gentes; these held a
council of the phratry and appealed in a body to the other phratry that it also
should assemble its council to effect a settlement. Here the phratry reappears
as the original gens, and with greater prospect of success than the weaker
single gens, its offspring. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -25px;">(4) At the death of prominent
persons the opposite phratry saw to the interment and the burial ceremonies,
while the phratry of the dead person attended as mourners. If a sachem died,
the opposite phratry reported to the federal council of the Iroquois that the
office was vacant. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -25px;">(5) The council of the phratry
also played a part in the election of a sachem. That the election would be
confirmed by the brother gentes was more or less taken for granted, but the
gentes of the opposite phratry might raise an objection. In this case the
council of the opposite phratry was assembled; if it maintained the objection,
the election was void. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -25px;">(6) The Iroquois formerly had
special religious mysteries, called medicine lodges by the white men. Among the
Senecas, these mysteries were celebrated by two religious brotherhoods, into
which new members were admitted by formal initiation; there was one such
brotherhood in each of the two phratries. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -25px;">(7) If, as is almost certain, the
four lineages occupying the four quarters of Tlascala at the time of the
conquest were four phratries, we here have proof that the phratries were also
military units, like the phratries among the Greeks and similar kinship
organizations among the Germans; these four lineages went into battle as
separate groups, each with its own uniform and flag, and under its own leader.
</p>

<p class="fst">As several gentes make up a phratry, so in the classic form
several phratries make up a tribe; in some cases, when tribes have been much
weakened, the intermediate form, the phratry, is absent. What distinguishes an
Indian tribe in America? </p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term">1. Its own territory and name.</span> In
addition to its actual place of settlement, every tribe further possessed
considerable territory for hunting and lashing. Beyond that lay a broad strip
of neutral land reaching to the territory of the neighboring tribe; it was
smaller between tribes related in language, larger between tribes not so
related. It is the same as the boundary forest of the Germans, the waste made
by Caesar's Suevi around their territory, the isarnholt (in Danish, jarnved,
limes Danicus) between Danes and Germans, the Sachsenwald (Saxon wood) and
branibor (Slav, "protecting wood") between Germans and Slavs, from which
Brandenburg takes its name. The territory delimited by these uncertain
boundaries was the common land of the tribe, recognized as such by neighboring
tribes and defended by the tribe itself against attacks. In most cases the
uncertainty of the boundaries only became a practical disadvantage when there
had been a great increase in population. The names of the tribes seem generally
to have arisen by chance rather than to have been deliberately chosen; in the
course of time it often happened that a tribe was called by another name among
the neighboring tribes than that which it used itself, just as the Germans were
first called Germans by the Celts. </p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term">2. A distinct dialect peculiar to the tribe
alone.</span> Tribe and dialect are substantially coextensive; the formation
through segmentation of new tribes and dialects was still proceeding in America
until quite recently, and most probably has not entirely stopped even today.
When two weakened tribes have merged into one, the exceptional case occurs of
two closely related dialects being spoken in the same tribe. The average
strength of American tribes is under 2,000 members; the Cherokees, however,
number about 26,000, the greatest number of Indians in the United States
speaking the same dialect. </p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term">3. The right to install into office the
Sachems and war-chiefs elected by the Gentes and the right to depose
them</span>, even against the will of their gens. As these sachems and
war-chiefs are members of the council of the tribe, these rights of the tribe
in regard to them explain themselves. Where a confederacy of tribes had been
formed, with all the tribes represented in a federal council, these rights were
transferred to the latter. </p>
<a name="4.1"></a> 

<p class="fst"><span class="term">4. The possession of common religious
conceptions (<i>mythology</i>) and ceremonies.</span> &ldquo;After the fashion of
barbarians the American Indians were a religious people.&rdquo; <span
class="note"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span> Their mythology has not yet been
studied at all critically. They already embodied their religious ideas-spirits
of every kind-in human form; but the lower stage of barbarism, which they had
reached, still knows no plastic representations, so-called idols. Their
religion is a cult of nature and of elemental forces, in process of development
to polytheism. The various tribes had their regular festivals, with definite
rites, especially dances and games. Dancing particularly was an essential part
of all religious ceremonies; each tribe held its own celebration separately.
</p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term">5. A tribal council for the common affairs of
the tribe.</span> It was composed of all the sachems and war-chiefs of the
different gentes, who were genuinely representative because they could be
deposed at any time. It held its deliberations in public, surrounded by the
other members of the tribe, who had the right to join freely in the discussion
and to make their views heard. The decision rested with the council. As a rule,
everyone was given a hearing who asked for it; the women could also have their
views expressed by a speaker of their own choice. Among the Iroquois the final
decision had to be unanimous, as was also the case in regard to many decisions
of the German mark communities. The tribal council was responsible especially
for the handling of relations with other tribes; it received and sent
embassies, declared war and made peace. If war broke out, it was generally
carried on by volunteers. In principle, every tribe was considered to be in a
state of war with every other tribe with which it had not expressly concluded a
treaty of peace. Military expeditions against such enemies were generally
organized by prominent individual warriors; they held a war-dance, and whoever
joined in the dance announced thereby his participation in the expedition. The
column was at once formed, and started off. The defense of the tribal territory
when attacked was also generally carried out by volunteers. The departure and
return of such columns were always an occasion of public festivities. The
consent of the tribal council was not required for such expeditions, and was
neither asked nor given. They find their exact counterpart in the private war
expeditions of the German retinues described by Tacitus, only with the
difference that among the Germans the retinues have already acquired a more
permanent character, forming a firm core already organized in peacetime to
which the other volunteers are attached in event of war. These war parties are
seldom large; the most important expeditions of the Indians, even to great
distances, were undertaken with insignificant forces. If several such parties
united for operations on a large scale, each was under the orders only of its
own leader. Unity in the plan of campaign was secured well or ill by a council
of these leaders. It is the same manner of warfare as we find described by
Ammianus Marcellinus among the Alemanni on the Upper Rhine in the fourth
century. </p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term">6. Among some tribes we find a head chief,
whose powers, however, are very slight.</span> He is one of the sachems, and in
situations demanding swift action he has to take provisional measures, until
the council can assemble and make a definite decision. His function represents
the first feeble attempt at the creation of an official with executive power,
though generally nothing more came of it; as we shall see, the executive
official developed in most cases, if not in all, out of the chief military
commander. </p>

<p>The great majority of the American Indians did not advance to any higher
form of association than the tribe. Living in small tribes, separated from one
another by wide tracts between their frontiers, weakened by incessant wars,
they occupied an immense territory with few people. Here and there alliances
between related tribes came into being in the emergency of the moment and broke
up when the emergency had passed. But in certain districts tribes which were
originally related and had then been dispersed, joined together again in
permanent federations, thus taking the first step towards the formation of
nations. In the United States we find the most developed form of such a
federation among the Iroquois. Emigrating from their homes west of the
Mississippi, where they probably formed a branch of the great Dakota family,
they settled after long wanderings in what is now the State of New York. They
were divided into five tribes: Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas, Oneidas and
Mohawks. They subsisted on fish, game, and the products of a crude
horticulture, and lived in villages, which were generally protected by a
stockade. Never more than twenty thousand strong, they had a number of gentes
common to all the five tribes, spoke closely related dialects of the same
language, and occupied a continuous stretch of territory which was divided up
among the five tribes. As they had newly conquered this territory, these tribes
were naturally accustomed to stand together against the Inhabitants they had
driven out. From this developed, at the beginning of the fifteenth century at
latest, a regular &ldquo;everlasting league,&rdquo; a sworn confederacy, which
in the consciousness of its new strength immediately assumed an aggressive
character, and at the height of its power, about 1675, conquered wide stretches
of the surrounding country, either expelling the inhabitants or making them pay
tribute. The Iroquois confederacy represents the most advanced social
organization achieved by any Indians still at the lower stage of barbarism
(excluding, therefore, the Mexicans, New Mexicans and Peruvians). </p>

<p>The main provisions of the confederacy were as follows: </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">1. Perpetual federation of the
five consanguineous tribes on the basis of complete equality and independence
in all internal matters of the tribe. This bond of kin represented the real
basis of the confederacy. Of the five tribes, three were known as father tribes
and were brother tribes to one another; the other two were known as son tribes,
and were likewise brother tribes to one another. Three gentes, the oldest,
still had their living representatives in all five tribes, and another three in
three tribes; the members of each of these gentes were all brothers of one
another throughout all the five tribes. Their common language, in which there
were only variations of dialect, was the expression and the proof of their
common descent. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">2. The organ of the confederacy
was federal council of fifty sachems, all equal in rank and authority; the
decisions of this council were final in all matters relating to the
confederacy. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">3. The fifty sachems were
distributed among the tribes and gentes at the foundation of the confederacy to
hold the new offices specially created for federal purposes. They were elected
by the respective gentes whenever a vacancy occurred and could be deposed by
the gentes at any time; but the right of investing them with their office
belonged to the federal council. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">4. These federal sachems were
also sachems in their respective tribes, and had a seat and a vote in the
tribal council. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">5. All decisions of the federal
council had to be unanimous. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">6. Voting was by tribes, so that
for a decision to be valid every tribe and all members of the council in every
tribe had to signify their agreement. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">7. Each of the five tribal
councils could convene the federal council, but it could not convene itself.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">8. The meetings of the council
were held in the presence of the assembled people; every Iroquois could speak;
the council alone decided. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">9. The confederacy had no
official head or chief executive officer. </p>

<p class="indent" style="text-indent: -20px;">10. On the other hand, the
council had two principal war-chiefs, with equal powers and equal authority
(the two "kings" of the Spartans, the two consuls in Rome). </p>
<hr class="section">
<br>


<p class="fst">That was the whole public constitution under which the Iroquois
lived for over four hundred years and are still living today. I have described
it fully, following Morgan, because here we have the opportunity of studying
the organization of a society which still has no <i>state</i>. The state presupposes a
special public power separated from the body of the people, and Maurer, who
with a true instinct recognizes that the constitution of the German mark is a
purely social institution, differing essentially from the state, though later
providing a great part of its basis, consequently investigates in all his
writings the gradual growth of the public power out of, and side by side with,
the primitive constitutions of marks, villages, homesteads, and towns. Among
the North American Indians we see how an originally homogeneous tribe gradually
spreads over a huge continent; how through division tribes become nations,
entire groups of tribes; how the languages change until they not only become
unintelligible to other tribes, but also lose almost every trace of their
original identity; how at the same time within the tribes each gens splits up
into several gentes, how the old mother gentes are preserved as phratries,
while the names of these oldest gentes nevertheless remain the same in widely
distant tribes that have long been separated-the Wolf and the Bear are still
gentile names among a majority of all Indian tribes. And the constitution
described above applies in the main to them all, except that many of them never
advanced as far as the confederacy of related tribes. </p>

<p>But once the gens is given as the social unit, we also see how the whole
constitution of gentes, phratries, and tribes is almost necessarily bound to
develop from this unit, because the development is natural. Gens, phratry, and
tribe are all groups of different degrees of consanguinity, each self-contained
and ordering its own affairs, but each supplementing the other. And the affairs
which fall within their sphere comprise all the public affairs of barbarians of
the lower stage. When we find a people with the gens as their social unit, we
may therefore also look for an organization of the tribe similar to that here
described; and when there are adequate sources, as in the case of the Greeks
and the Romans, we shall not only find it, but we shall also be able to
convince ourselves that where the sources fail us, comparison with the American
social constitution helps us over the most difficult doubts and riddles. </p>

<p>And a wonderful constitution it is, this gentile constitution, in all its
childlike simplicity! No soldiers, no gendarmes or police, no nobles, kings,
regents, prefects, or judges, no prisons, no lawsuits &ndash; and everything takes
its orderly course. All quarrels and disputes are settled by the whole of the
community affected, by the gens or the tribe, or by the gentes among
themselves; only as an extreme and exceptional measure is blood revenge
threatened-and our capital punishment is nothing but blood revenge in a
civilized form, with all the advantages and drawbacks of civilization. Although
there were many more matters to be settled in common than today &ndash; the household
is maintained by a number of families in common, and is communistic, the land
belongs to the tribe, only the small gardens are allotted provisionally to the
households &ndash; yet there is no need for even a trace of our complicated
administrative apparatus with all its ramifications. The decisions are taken by
those concerned, and in most cases everything has been already settled by the
custom of centuries. There cannot be any poor or needy &ndash; the communal household
and the gens know their responsibilities towards the old, the sick, and those
disabled in war. All are equal and free &ndash; the women included. There is no place
yet for slaves, nor, as a rule, for the subjugation of other tribes. When,
about the year 1651, the Iroquois had conquered the Eries and the
&ldquo;Neutral Nation,&rdquo; they offered to accept them into the confederacy
on equal terms; it was only after the defeated tribes had refused that they
were driven from their territory. And what men and women such a society breeds
is proved by the admiration inspired in all white people who have come into
contact with unspoiled Indians, by the personal dignity, uprightness, strength
of character, and courage of these barbarians. </p>

<p>We have seen examples of this courage quite recently in Africa. The Zulus a
few years ago and the Nubians a few months ago &ndash; both of them tribes in
which gentile institutions have not yet died out &ndash; did what no European
army can do. Armed only with lances and spears, without firearms, under a hail
of bullets from the breech-loaders of the English infantry &ndash; acknowledged the
best in the world at fighting in close order &ndash; they advanced right up to
the bayonets and more than once threw the lines into disorder and even broke
them, in spite of the enormous inequality of weapons and in spite of the fact
that they have no military service and know nothing of drill. Their powers of
endurance and performance are shown by the complaint of the English that a
Kaffir travels farther and faster in twenty-four hours than a horse. His
smallest muscle stands out hard and firm like whipcord, says an English
painter. </p>

<p>That is what men and society were before the division into classes. And when
we compare their position with that of the overwhelming majority of civilized
men today, an enormous gulf separates the present-day proletarian and small
peasant from the free member of the old gentile society. </p>
<a name="5.1"></a> 

<p>That is the one side. But we must not forget that this organization was
doomed. It did not go beyond the tribe. The confederacy of tribes already marks
the beginning of its collapse, as will soon be apparent, and was already
apparent in the attempts at subjugation by the Iroquois. Outside the tribe was
outside the law. Wherever there was not an explicit treaty of peace, tribe was
at war with tribe, and wars were waged with the cruelty which distinguishes man
from other animals, and which was only mitigated later by self-interest. The
gentile constitution in its best days, as we saw it in America, presupposed an
extremely undeveloped state of production and therefore an extremely sparse
population over a wide area. Man&rsquo;s attitude to nature was therefore one
of almost complete subjection to a strange incomprehensible power, as is
reflected in his childish religious conceptions. Man was bounded by his tribe,
both in relation to strangers from outside the tribe and to himself; the tribe,
the gens, and their institutions were sacred and inviolable, a higher power
established by nature, to which the individual subjected himself
unconditionally in feeling, thought, and action. However impressive the people
of this epoch appear to us, they are completely undifferentiated from one
another; as Marx says, they are still attached to the navel string of the
primitive community. <span class="note"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span> The power
of this primitive community had to be broken, and it was broken. But it was
broken by influences which from the very start appear as a degradation, a fall
from the simple moral greatness of the old gentile society. The lowest
interests &ndash; base greed, brutal appetites, sordid avarice, selfish robbery
of the common wealth &ndash; inaugurate the new, civilized, class society. It
is by the vilest means &ndash; theft, violence, fraud, treason &ndash; that the
old classless gentile society is undermined and overthrown. And the new society
itself, during all the two and a half thousand years of its existence, has
never been anything else but the development of the small minority at the
expense of the great exploited and oppressed majority; today it is so more than
ever before. </p>
