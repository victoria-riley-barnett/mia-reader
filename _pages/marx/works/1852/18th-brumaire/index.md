On December 2 1851, followers of President Louis Bonaparte (Napoleon\'s
nephew) broke up the Legislative Assembly and established a
dictatorship. A year later, Louis Bonaparte proclaimed himself Emperor
Napoleon III.

Marx wrote *The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon* between December
1851 and March 1852. The \"Eighteenth Brumaire\" refers to November 9,
1799 in the French Revolutionary Calendar --- the day the first Napoleon
Bonaparte had made himself dictator by a coup d\'etat.

In this work Marx traces how the conflict of different social interests
manifest themselves in the complex web of political struggles, and in
particular the contradictory relationships between the outer form of a
struggle and its real social content. The proletariat of Paris was at
this time too inexperienced to win power, but the experiences of 1848-51
would prove invaluable for the successful workers\' revolution of 1871.

See [Chapter 6](ch06.htm#summary) for a succinct time line of the
period.
