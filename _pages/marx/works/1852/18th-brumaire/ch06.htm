<p class="title">The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte. 1852</p>

<h1>VI</h1>

<p class="fst">The coalition with the Montagne and the pure republicans, to
which the party of Order saw itself condemned in its unavailing efforts to
maintain possession of the military power and to reconquer supreme control of
the executive power, proved incontrovertibly that it had forfeited its
independent parliamentary majority. On May 28 the mere power of the calendar,
of the hour hand of the clock, gave the signal for its complete disintegration.
With May 28, the last year of the life of the National Assembly began. It now
had to decide for continuing the constitution unaltered or for revising it. But
revision of the constitution &mdash; that implied not only rule of the
bourgeoisie or of the petty-bourgeois democracy, democracy or proletarian
anarchy, parliamentary republic or Bonaparte, it implied at the same time
Orleans or Bourbon! Thus fell in the midst of parliament the apple of discord
that was bound to inflame openly the conflict of interests which split the
party of Order into hostile factions. The party of Order was a combination of
heterogeneous social substances. The question of revision generated a political
temperature at which the product again decomposed into its original components.
</p>

<p>The Bonapartists' interest in a revision was simple. For them it was above
all a question of abolishing Article 45, which forbade Bonaparte's reelection
and the prolongation of his authority. No less simple appeared the position of
the republicans. They unconditionally rejected any revision; they saw in it a
universal conspiracy against the republic. Since they commanded more than a
quarter of the votes in the National Assembly, and according to the
constitution three-quarters of the votes were required for a resolution for
revision to be legally valid and for the convocation of a revising Assembly,
they needed only to count their votes to be sure of victory. And they were sure
of victory. </p>

<p>As against these clear positions, the party of Order found itself
inextricably caught in contradictions. If it should reject revision, it would
imperil the status quo, since it would leave Bonaparte only one way out, that
of force; and since on the second Sunday in May, 1852, at the decisive moment,
it would be surrendering France to revolutionary anarchy, with a President who
had lost his authority, with a parliament which for a long time had not
possessed it, and with a people that meant to reconquer it. If it voted for
constitutional revision, it knew that it voted in vain and would be bound to
fail constitutionally because of the republicans' veto. If it
unconstitutionally declared a simple majority vote to be binding, it could hope
to dominate the revolution only if it subordinated itself unconditionally to
the sovereignty of the executive power; then it would make Bonaparte master of
the constitution, of its revision, and of the party itself. A partial revision,
which would prolong the authority of the President, would pave the way for
imperial usurpation. A general revision, which would shorten the existence of
the republic, would bring the dynastic claims into unavoidable conflict, for
the conditions of a Bourbon and an Orleanist restoration were not only
different, they were mutually exclusive. </p>

<p>The parliamentary republic was more than the neutral territory on which the
two factions of the French bourgeoisie, Legitimists and Orleanists, large
landed property and industry, could dwell side by side with equality of rights.
It was the unavoidable condition of their common rule, the sole form of state
in which their general class interest subjected to itself at the same time both
the claims of their particular factions and all the remaining classes of
society. As royalists they fell back into their old antagonism, into the
struggle for the supremacy of landed property or of money, and the highest
expression of this antagonism, its personification, was their kings themselves,
their dynasties. Hence the resistance of the party of Order to the recall of
the Bourbons. </p>

<p>The Orleanist and people's representative Creton had in 1849, 1850, and 1851
periodically introduced a motion for the revocation of the decree exiling the
royal families. Just as regularly, parliament presented the spectacle of an
Assembly of royalists that obdurately barred the gates through which their
exiled kings might return home. Richard III murdered Henry VI, remarking that
he was too good for this world and belonged in heaven. The royalists declared
France too bad to possess her kings again. Constrained by force of
circumstances, they had become republicans and repeatedly sanctioned the
popular decision that banished their kings from France. </p>

<p>A revision of the constitution &mdash; and circumstances compelled taking
that into consideration &mdash; called in question, along with the republic,
the common rule of the two bourgeois factions, and revived, with the
possibility of a monarchy, the rivalry of the interests which the monarchy had
predominantly represented by turns, the struggle for the supremacy of one
faction over the other. The diplomats of the party of Order believed they could
settle the struggle by an amalgamation of the two dynasties, by a so-called
fusion of the royalist parties and their royal houses. The real fusion of the
Restoration and the July Monarchy was the parliamentary republic, in which
Orleanist and Legitimist colors were obliterated and the various species of
bourgeois disappeared into the bourgeois as such, the bourgeois genus. Now,
however, Orleanist was to become Legitimist and Legitimist Orleanist. Royalty,
in which their antagonism was personified, was to embody their unity, the
expression of their exclusive factional interests was to become the expression
of their common class interest, the monarchy was to do what only the abolition
of two monarchies, the republic, could do and had done. This was the
philosopher's stone, to produce which the doctors of the party of Order racked
their brains. As if the Legitimist monarchy could ever become the monarchy of
the industrial bourgeois or the bourgeois monarchy ever become the monarchy of
the hereditary landed aristocracy. As if landed property and industry could
fraternize under one crown, when the crown could descend to only one head, the
head of the elder brother or of the younger. As if industry could come to terms
with landed property at all, so long as landed property itself does not decide
to become industrial. If Henry V should die tomorrow, the Count of Paris would
not on that account become the king of the Legitimists unless he ceased to be
the king of the Orleanists. The philosophers of fusion, however, who became
more vociferous in proportion as the question of revision came to the fore, who
had provided themselves with an official daily organ in the <em>Assemblee
Nationale</em>, and who are again at work even at this very moment (February,
1852), considered the whole difficulty to be due to the opposition and rivalry
of the two dynasties. The attempts to reconcile the Orleans family with Henry
V, begun since the death of Louis Philippe, but, like the dynastic intrigues
generally, played at only while the National Assembly was in recess, during the
entr'actes, behind the scenes &mdash; sentimental coquetry with the old
superstition rather than seriously meant business &mdash; now became grand
performances of state, enacted by the party of Order on the public stage,
instead of in amateur theatricals as before. The couriers sped from Paris to
Venice, from Venice to Claremont,<sup class="enote"><a
href="notes.htm#n112">[112]</a></sup> from Claremont to Paris. The Count of
Chambord issues a manifesto in which "with the help of all the members of his
family" he announces not his, but the "national" restoration. The Orleanist
Salvandy throws himself at the feet of Henry V. The Legitimist chiefs, Berryer,
Benoit d'Azy, Saint-Priest, travel to Claremont to persuade the Orleans set,
but in vain. The fusionists perceive too late that the interests of the two
bourgeois factions neither lose exclusiveness nor gain pliancy when they become
accentuated in the form of family interests, the interests of two royal houses.
If Henry V were to recognize the Count of Paris as his heir - the sole success
that the fusion could achieve at best &mdash; the House of Orleans would not
win any claim that the childlessness of Henry V had not already secured to it,
but it would lose all the claims it had gained through the July Revolution. It
would waive its original claims, all the titles it had wrested from the older
branch of the Bourbons in almost a hundred years of struggle; it would barter
away its historical prerogative, the prerogative of the modern kingdom, for the
prerogative of its genealogical tree. The fusion, therefore, would be nothing
but a voluntary abdication of the House of Orleans, its resignation to
Legitimacy, repentant withdrawal from the Protestant state church into the
Catholic. A withdrawal, moreover, that would not even bring it to the throne it
had lost, but to the steps of the throne where it had been born. The old
Orleanist ministers, Guizot, Duchatel, etc., who likewise hastened to Claremont
to advocate the fusion, in fact represented merely the Katzenjammer over the
July Revolution, the despair about the bourgeois kingdom and the kingliness of
the bourgeois, the superstitious belief in Legitimacy as the last charm against
anarchy. Imagining themselves mediators between Orleans and Bourbons, they were
in reality merely Orleanist renegades, and the Prince of Joinville received
them as such. On the other hand, the viable, bellicose section of the
Orleanists, Thiers, Baze, etc., convinced Louis Philippe's family all the more
easily that if any directly monarchist restoration presupposed the fusion of
the two dynasties, and if any such fusion presupposed abdication of the House
of Orleans, it was, on the contrary, wholly in accord with the tradition of
their forefathers to recognize the republic for the moment and wait until
events permitted the conversion of the presidential chair into a throne. Rumors
of Joinville's candidature were circulated, public curiosity was kept in
suspense, and a few months later, in September, after the rejection of
revision, his candidature was publicly proclaimed. </p>

<p>The attempt at a royalist fusion of Orleanists with Legitimists had thus not
only failed; it had destroyed their <i>parliamentary fusion</i>, their common
republican form, and had broken up the party of Order into its original
component parts; but the more the estrangement between Claremont and Venice
grew, the more their settlement collapsed and the Joinville agitation gained
ground, so much the more eager and earnest became the negotiations between
Bonaparte's minister Faucher and the Legitimists. </p>

<p>The disintegration of the party of Order did not stop at its original
elements. Each of the two great factions, in its turn, decomposed all over
again. It was as if all the old shadings that had formerly fought and jostled
one another within each of the two circles, whether Legitimist or Orleanist,
had thawed out again like dry Infusoria on contact with water, as if they had
acquired anew sufficient vital energy to form groups of their own and
independent antagonisms. The Legitimists dreamed they were back among the
controversies between the Tuileries and the Pavillon Marsan, between Villèle
and Polignac.<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.htm#n113">[113]</a></sup> The
Orleanists relived the golden days of the tourney between Guizot, Mole,
Broglie, Thiers, and Odilon Barrot. </p>

<p>The section of the party of Order that was eager for revision, but was
divided again on the limits to revisions &mdash; a section composed of the
Legitimists led by Berryer and Falloux, on the one hand, and by La
Rochejaquelein, on the other, and of the conflict-weary Orleanists led by Mole,
Broglie, Montalembert and Odilon Barrot &mdash; agreed with the Bonapartist
representatives on the following indefinite and broadly framed motion: "With
the object of restoring to the nation the full exercise of its sovereignty, the
undersigned representatives move that the constitution be revised." </p>

<p>At the same time, however, they unanimously declared through their reporter
Tocqueville that the National Assembly had no right to move the <i>abolition of
the republic</i>, that this right was vested solely in the Revising Chamber.
For the rest, the constitution might be revised only in a "<i>legal</i>"
<i>manner</i>, hence only if the constitutionally prescribed three-quarters of
the number of votes were cast in favor of revision. On July 19, after six days
of stormy debate, revision was rejected, as was to be anticipated. Four hundred
and forty-six votes were cast for it, but two hundred and seventy-eight
against. The extreme Orleanists, Thiers, Changarnier, etc., voted with the
republicans and the Montagne. </p>

<p>Thus the majority of parliament declared against the constitution, but this
constitution itself declared for the minority and that its vote was binding.
But had not the party of Order subordinated the constitution to the
parliamentary majority on May 31, 1850, and on June 13, 1849? Up to now, was
not its whole policy based on the subordination of the paragraphs of the
constitution to the decisions of the parliamentary majority? Had it not left to
the democrats the antediluvian superstitious belief in the letter of the law,
and castigated the democrats for it? At the present moment, however, revision
of the constitution meant nothing but continuation of the presidential
authority, just as continuation of the constitution meant nothing but
Bonaparte's deposition. Parliament had declared for him, but the constitution
declared against parliament. He therefore acted in the sense of parliament when
he tore up the constitution and acted in the sense of the constitution when he
adjourned parliament. </p>

<p>Parliament had declared the constitution and, with the latter, its own rule
to be "beyond the majority"; by its vote it had abolished the constitution and
prolonged the term of presidential power, while declaring at the same time that
neither could the one die nor the other live so long as the Assembly itself
continued to exist. Those who were to bury it were standing at the door. While
it debated on revision, Bonaparte removed General Baraguay d'Hilliers, who had
proved irresolute, from the command of the First Army Division and appointed in
his place General Magnan, the victor of Lyons,<sup class="enote"><a
href="notes.htm#n114">[114]</a></sup> the hero of the December days, one of his
creatures, who under Louis Philippe had already more or less compromised
himself in Bonaparte's favor on the occasion of the Boulogne expedition. </p>

<p>The party of Order proved by its decision on revision that it knew neither
how to rule nor how to serve; neither how to live nor how to die; neither how
to suffer the republic nor how to overthrow it; neither how to uphold the
constitution nor how to throw it overboard; neither how to cooperate with the
President nor how to break with him. To whom, then, did it look for the
solution of all the contradictions? To the calendar, to the course of events.
It ceased to presume to sway them. It therefore challenged events to assume
sway over it, and thereby challenged the power to which, in the struggle
against the people, it had surrendered one attribute after another until it
stood impotent before this power. In order that the head of the executive power
might be able the more undisturbedly to draw up his plan of campaign against
it, strengthen his means of attack, select his tools, and fortify his
positions, it resolved precisely at this critical moment to retire from the
stage and adjourn for three months, from August 10 to November 4. </p>

<p>The parliamentary party was not only dissolved into its two great factions,
each of these factions was not only split up within itself, but the party of
Order in parliament had fallen out with the party of Order outside parliament.
The spokesmen and scribes of the bourgeoisie, its platform and its press
&mdash; in short, the ideologists of the bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie
itself, the representatives and the represented &mdash; faced one another in
estrangement and no longer understood one another. </p>

<p>The Legitimists in the provinces, with their limited horizon and unlimited
enthusiasm, accused their parliamentary leaders, Berryer and Falloux, of
deserting to the Bonapartist camp and of defection from Henry V. Their
fleur-de-lis minds believed in the fall of man, but not in diplomacy. </p>

<p>Far more fateful and decisive was the breach of the commercial bourgeoisie
with its politicians. It reproached them not as the Legitimists reproached
theirs, with having abandoned their principles, but on the contrary, with
clinging to principles that had become useless. </p>

<p>I have indicated above that since Fould's entry into the ministry the
section of the commercial bourgeoisie which had held the lion's share of power
under Louis Philippe, namely, the aristocracy of finance, had become
Bonapartist. Fould not only represented Bonaparte's interests in the Bourse, he
represented at the same time the interests of the Bourse before Bonaparte. The
position of the aristocracy of finance is most strikingly depicted in a passage
from its European organ, the <i>London Economist</i>. In the issue of February
1, 1851, its Paris correspondent writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Now we have it stated from numerous quarters that above all
things France demands tranquillity. The President declares it in his message to
the Legislative Assembly; it is echoed from the tribune; it is asserted in the
journals; it is announced from the pulpit, it is demonstrated by the
sensitiveness of the public funds at the least prospect of disturbance, and
their firmness the instant it is made manifest that the executive is
victorious." </p>

<p>In its issue of November 29, 1851, the Economist declares in its own
name:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The President is the guardian of order, and is now
recognized as such on every stock exchange of Europe." </p>

<p>The aristocracy of finance, therefore, condemned the parliamentary struggle
of the party of Order with the executive power as a disturbance of order, and
celebrated every victory of the President over its ostensible representatives
as a victory of order. By the aristocracy of finance must here be understood
not merely the great loan promoters and speculators in public funds, in regard
to whom it is immediately obvious that their interests coincide with the
interests of the state power. All modern finance, the whole of the banking
business, is interwoven in the closest fashion with public credit. A part of
their business capital is necessarily invested and put out at interest in
quickly convertible public funds. Their deposits, the capital placed at their
disposal and distributed by them among merchants and industrialists, are partly
derived from the dividends of holders of government securities. If in every
epoch the stability of the state power signified Moses and the prophets to the
entire money market and to the priests of this money market, why not all the
more so today, when every deluge threatens to sweep away the old states, and
the old state debts with them? </p>

<p>The industrial bourgeoisie too, in its fanaticism for order, was angered by
the squabbles of the parliamentary party of Order with the executive power.
After their vote of January 18 on the occasion of Changarnier's dismissal,
Thiers, Angles, Sainte-Beuve, etc., received from their constituents, in
precisely the industrial districts, public reproofs in which their coalition
with the Montagne was especially scourged as high treason to order. If, as we
have seen, the boastful taunts, the petty intrigues which marked the struggle
of the party of Order with the President merited no better reception, then on
the other hand this bourgeois party, which required its representatives to
allow the military power to pass from its own parliament to an adventurous
pretender without offering resistance, was not even worth the intrigues that
were squandered in its interests. It proved that the struggle to maintain its
public interests, its own class interests, its political power, only troubled
and upset it, as it disturbed private business. </p>

<p>With barely an exception the bourgeois dignitaries of the departmental
towns, the municipal authorities, the judges of the commercial courts, etc.,
everywhere received Bonaparte on his tours in the most servile manner, even
when, as in Dijon, he made an unrestrained attack on the National Assembly, and
especially on the party of Order. </p>

<p>When trade was good, as it still was at the beginning of 1851, the
commercial bourgeoisie raged against any parliamentary struggle, lest trade be
put out of humor. When trade was bad, as it continually was from the end of
February, 1851, the commercial bourgeoisie accused the parliamentary struggles
of being the cause of stagnation and cried out for them to stop so that trade
could start again. The revision debates came on just in this bad period. Since
the question here was whether the existing form of state was to be or not to
be, the bourgeoisie felt all the more justified in demanding from its
representatives the ending of this torturous provisional arrangement and at the
same time the maintenance of the status quo. There was no contradiction in
this. By the end of the provisional arrangement it understood precisely its
continuation, the postponement to a distant future of the moment when a
decision had to be reached. The status quo could be maintained in only two
ways: prolongation of Bonaparte's authority or his constitutional retirement
and the election of Cavaignac. A section of the bourgeoisie desired the latter
solution and knew no better advice to give its representatives than to keep
silent and leave the burning question untouched. They were of the opinion that
if their representatives did not speak, Bonaparte would not act. They wanted an
ostrich parliament that would hide its head in order to remain unseen. Another
section of the bourgeoisie desired, because Bonaparte was already in the
presidential chair, to leave him sitting in it, so that everything could remain
in the same old rut. They were indignant because their parliament did not
openly infringe the constitution and abdicate without ceremony. </p>

<p>The Department Councils, those provincial representative bodies of the big
bourgeoisie, which met from August 25 on during the recess of the National
Assembly, declared almost unanimously for revision, and thus against parliament
and in favor of Bonaparte. </p>

<p>Still more unequivocally than in its falling out with its parliamentary
representatives, the bourgeoisie displayed its wrath against its literary
representatives, its own press. The sentences to ruinous fines and shameless
terms of imprisonment, on the verdicts of bourgeois juries, for every attack of
bourgeois journalists on Bonaparte's usurpationist desires, for every attempt
of the press to defend the political rights of the bourgeoisie against the
executive power, astonished not merely France, but all Europe. </p>

<p>While the parliamentary party of Order, by its clamor for tranquillity, as I
have shown, committed itself to quiescence, while it declared the political
rule of the bourgeoisie to be incompatible with the safety and existence of the
bourgeoisie &mdash; by destroying with its own hands, in the struggle against
the other classes of society, all the conditions for its own regime, the
parliamentary regime &mdash; the extraparliamentary mass of the bourgeoisie, on
the other hand, by its servility toward the President, by its vilification of
parliament, by its brutal maltreatment of its own press, invited Bonaparte to
suppress and annihilate its speaking and writing section, its politicians and
its literati, its platform and its press, so it would then be able to pursue
its private affairs with full confidence in the protection of a strong and
unrestricted government. It declared unequivocally that it longed to get rid of
its own political rule in order to get rid of the troubles and dangers of
ruling. </p>

<p>And this extraparliamentary bourgeoisie, which had already rebelled against
the purely parliamentary and literary struggle for the rule of its own class,
and had betrayed the leaders of this struggle, now dares after the event to
indict the proletariat for not having risen in a bloody struggle, a
life-and-death struggle on its behalf! This bourgeoisie, which every moment
sacrificed its general class interests, that is, its political interests, to
the narrowest and most sordid private interests, and demanded a similar
sacrifice from its representatives, now moans that the proletariat has
sacrificed its ideal political interests to its material interests. It poses as
a lovely creature that has been misunderstood and deserted in the decisive hour
by the proletariat, misled by socialists. And it finds a general echo in the
bourgeois world. Naturally, I do not speak here of German shyster politicians
and riff-raff of the same persuasion. I refer, for example, to the already
quoted Economist, which as late as November 29, 1851, that is, four days prior
to the coup d'etat, declared Bonaparte to be the "guardian of order" but Thiers
and Berryer to be "anarchists," and on December 27, 1851, after Bonaparte had
quieted these "anarchists," is already vociferous about the treason to "the
skill, knowledge, discipline, spiritual insight, intellectual resources, and
moral weight of the middle and upper ranks" committed by the masses of
"ignorant, untrained, and stupid proletaires." The stupid, ignorant, and vulgar
mass was none other than the bourgeois mass itself. </p>

<p>In the year 1851, France, to be sure, had passed through a kind of minor
trade crisis. The end of February showed a decline in exports compared with
1850; in March trade suffered and factories closed down; in April the position
of the industrial departments appeared as desperate as after the February days;
in May business had still not revived; as late as June 28 the holdings of the
Bank of France showed, by the enormous growth of deposits and the equally great
decrease in advances on bills of exchange, that production was at a standstill,
and it was not until the middle of October that a progressive improvement of
business again set in. The French bourgeoisie attributed this trade stagnation
to purely political causes, to the struggle between parliament and the
executive power, to the precariousness of a merely provisional form of state,
to the terrifying prospect of the second Sunday in May of 1852. I will not deny
that all these circumstances had a depressing effect on some branches of
industry in Paris and the departments. But in any case the influence of
political conditions was only local and inconsiderable. Does this require
further proof than the fact that the improvement of trade set in toward the
middle of October, at the very moment when the political situation grew worse,
the political horizon darkened, and a thunderbolt from Elysium was expected at
any moment? For the rest, the French bourgeois, whose "skill, knowledge,
spiritual insight, and intellectual resources" reach no further than his nose,
could throughout the period of the Industrial Exhibition in London<sup
class="enote"><a href="notes.htm#n115">[115]</a></sup> have found the cause of
his commercial misery right under his nose. While in France factories were
closed down, in England commercial bankruptcies broke out. While in April and
May the industrial panic reached a climax in France, in April and May the
commercial panic reached a climax in England. Like the French woolen industry,
the English woolen industry suffered, and as French silk manufacture, so did
English silk manufacture. True, the English cotton mills continued working, but
no longer at the same profits as in 1849 and 1850. The only difference was that
the crisis in France was industrial, in England commercial; that while in
France the factories stood idle, in England they extended operations, but under
less favorable conditions than in preceding years; that in France it was
exports, in England imports which were hardest hit. The common cause, which is
naturally not to be sought within the bounds of the French political horizon,
was obvious. The years 1849 and 1850 were years of the greatest material
prosperity and of an overproduction that appeared as such only in 1851. At the
beginning of this year it was given a further special impetus by the prospect
of the Industrial Exhibition. In addition there were the following special
circumstances: first, the partial failure of the cotton crop in 1850 and 1851,
then the certainty of a bigger cotton crop than had been expected; first the
rise, then the sudden fall &mdash; in short, the fluctuations in the price of
cotton. The crop of raw silk, in France at least, had turned out to be even
below the average yield. Woolen manufacture, finally, had expanded so much
since 1848 that the production of wool could not keep pace with it and the
price of raw wool rose out of all proportion to the price of woolen
manufactures. Here, then, in the raw material of three industries for the world
market, we already have three-fold material for a stagnation in trade. Apart
from these special circumstances, the apparent crisis of 1851 was nothing else
but the halt which overproduction and overspeculation invariably make in
completing the industrial cycle, before they summon all their strength in order
to rush feverishly through the final phase of this cycle and arrive once more
at their starting point, the general trade crisis. During such intervals in the
history of trade, commercial bankruptcies break out in England, while in France
industry itself is reduced to idleness, partly forced into retreat by the
competition, just then becoming intolerable, of the English in all markets, and
partly singled out for attack as a luxury industry by every business
stagnation. Thus besides the general crisis France goes through national trade
crises of her own, which are nevertheless determined and conditioned far more
by the general state of the world market than by French local influences. It
will not be without interest to contrast the judgment of the English bourgeois
with the prejudice of the French bourgeois. In its annual trade report for
1851, one of the largest Liverpool houses writes: </p>

<p class="quote">"Few years have more thoroughly belied the anticipations
formed at their commencement than the one just closed; instead of the great
prosperity which was almost unanimously looked for it has proved one of the
most discouraging that has been seen for the last quarter of a century &mdash;
this, of course, refers to the mercantile, not to the manufacturing classes.
And yet there certainly were grounds for anticipating the reverse at the
beginning of the year &mdash; stocks of produce were moderate, money was
abundant, and food was cheap, a plentiful harvest well secured, unbroken peace
on the Continent, and no political or fiscal disturbances at home; indeed, the
wings of commerce were never more unfettered.... To what source, then, is this
disastrous result to be attributed? We believe to overtrading in both imports
and exports. Unless our merchants will put more stringent limits to their
freedom of action, nothing but a triennial panic can keep us in check." </p>

<p>Now picture to yourself the French bourgeois, how in the throes of this
business panic his trade-crazy brain is tortured, set in a whirl, and stunned
by rumors of coups d'etat and the restoration of universal suffrage, by the
struggle between parliament and the executive power, by the Fronde war between
Orleanists and Legitimists, by the communist conspiracies in the south of
France, by alleged Jacqueries in the departments of Nievre and Cher, by the
advertisements of the different candidates for the presidency, by the cheapjack
solutions offered by the journals, by the threats of the republicans to uphold
the constitution and universal suffrage by force of arms, by the
gospel-preaching emigre heroes <em>in partibus</em>, who announced that the
world would come to an end on the second Sunday in May, 1852 &mdash; think of
all this and you will comprehend why in this unspeakable, deafening chaos of
fusion, revision, prorogation, constitution, conspiration, coalition,
emigration, usurpation, and revolution, the bourgeois madly snorts at his
parliamentary republic:</p>

<p>"Rather an end with terror than terror without end!" </p>

<p>Bonaparte understood this cry. His power of comprehension was sharpened by
the growing turbulence of creditors, who with each sunset which brought
settling day, the second Sunday in May, 1852, nearer, saw a movement of the
stars protesting their earthly bills of exchange. They had become veritable
astrologers. The National Assembly had blighted Bonaparte's hopes of a
constitutional prolongation of his authority; the candidature of the Prince of
Joinville forbade further vacillation. </p>

<p>If ever an event has, well in advance of its coming, cast its shadow before,
it was Bonaparte's coup d'etat. As early as January 29, 1849, barely a month
after his election, he had made a proposal about it to Changarnier. In the
summer of 1849 his own Prime Minister, Odilon Barrot, had covertly denounced
the policy of coups d'etat; in the winter of 1850 Thiers had openly done so. In
May, 1851, Persigny had sought once more to win Changarnier for the coup; the
<em>Messager de l'Assemblee</em> had published an account of these
negotiations. During every parliamentary storm the Bonapartist journals
threatened a coup d'etat, and the nearer the crisis drew, the louder their tone
became. In the orgies that Bonaparte kept up every night with men and women of
the "swell mob," as soon as the hour of midnight approached and copious
potations had loosened tongues and fired imaginations, the coup d'etat was
fixed for the following morning. Swords were drawn, glasses clinked, the
representatives were thrown out the window, the imperial mantle fell upon
Bonaparte's shoulders, until the following morning banished the ghost once more
and astonished Paris learned, from vestals of little reticence and from
indiscreet paladins, of the danger it had once again escaped. During the months
of September and October rumors of a coup d'etat followed fast, one after the
other. Simultaneously the shadow took on color, like a variegated
daguerreotype. Look up the September and October copies of the organs of the
European daily press and you will find, word for word, intimations like the
following: "Paris is full of rumors of a coup d'etat. The capital is to be
filled with troops during the night, and the next morning is to bring decrees
which will dissolve the National Assembly, declare the Department of the Seine
in a state of siege, restore universal suffrage, and appeal to the people.
Bonaparte is said to be seeking ministers for the execution of these illegal
decrees." The dispatches that bring these tidings always end with the fateful
word "postponed." The coup d'etat was ever the fixed idea of Bonaparte. With
this idea he had again set foot on French soil. He was so obsessed by it that
he continually betrayed it and blurted it out. He was so weak that, just as
continually, he gave it up again. The shadow of the coup d'etat had become so
familiar to the Parisians as a specter that they were not willing to believe in
it when it finally appeared in the flesh. What allowed the coup d'etat to
succeed was therefore neither the reticent reserve of the chief of the Society
of December 10 nor the fact that the National Assembly was caught unawares. If
it succeeded, it succeeded despite its indiscretion and with its foreknowledge,
a necessary, inevitable result of antecedent developments. </p>

<p>On October 10 Bonaparte announced to his ministers his decision to restore
universal suffrage; on the sixteenth they handed in their resignations; on the
twenty-sixth Paris learned of the formation of the Thorigny Ministry. Police
Prefect Carlier was simultaneously replaced by Maupas; the head of the First
Military Division, Magnan, concentrated the most reliable regiments in the
capital. On November 4 the National Assembly resumed its sessions. It had
nothing better to do than to recapitulate in a short, succinct form the course
it had gone through and to prove that it was buried only after it had died. </p>

<p>The first post it forfeited in the struggle with the executive power was the
ministry. It had solemnly to admit this loss by accepting at full value the
Thorigny Ministry, a mere shadow cabinet. The Permanent Commission had received
M. Giraud with laughter when he presented himself in the name of the new
ministers. Such a weak ministry for such strong measures as the restoration of
universal suffrage! Yet the precise object was to get nothing through in
parliament, but everything against parliament. </p>

<p>On the very first day of its reopening, the National Assembly received the
message from Bonaparte in which he demanded the restoration of universal
suffrage and the abolition of the law of May 31, 1850. The same day his
ministers introduced a decree to this effect. The National Assembly at once
rejected the ministry's motion of urgency and rejected the law itself on
November 13 by three hundred and fifty-five votes to three hundred and
forty-eight. Thus, it tore up its mandate once more; it once more confirmed the
fact that it had transformed itself from the freely elected representatives of
the people into the usurpatory parliament of a class; it acknowledged once more
that it had itself cut in two the muscles which connected the parliamentary
head with the body of the nation. </p>

<p>If by its motion to restore universal suffrage the executive power appealed
from the National Assembly to the people, the legislative power appealed by its
Quaestors' Bill from the people to the army. This Quaestors' Bill was to
establish its right of directly requisitioning troops, of forming a
parliamentary army. While it thus designated the army as the arbitrator between
itself and the people, between itself and Bonaparte, while it recognized the
army as the decisive state power, it had to confirm, on the other hand, the
fact that it had long given up its claim to dominate this power. By debating
its right to requisition troops, instead of requisitioning them at once, it
betrayed its doubts about its own powers. By rejecting the Quaestors' Bill, it
made public confession of its impotence. This bill was defeated, its proponents
lacking a hundred and eight votes of a majority. The Montagne thus decided the
issue. It found itself in the position of Buridan's ass &mdash; not, indeed,
between two bundles of hay with the problem of deciding which was the more
attractive, but between two showers of blows with the problem of deciding which
was the harder. On the one hand, there was the fear of Changarnier; on the
other, the fear of Bonaparte. It must be confessed that the position was not a
heroic one. </p>

<p>On November 18 an amendment was moved to the law on municipal elections
introduced by the party of Order, to the effect that instead of three years',
one year's domicile should suffice for municipal electors. The amendment was
lost by a single vote, but this one vote immediately proved to be a mistake. By
splitting up into its hostile factions, the party of Order had long ago
forfeited its independent parliamentary majority. It showed now that there was
no longer any majority at all in parliament. The National Assembly had become
incapable of transacting business. Its atomic constituents were no longer held
together by any force of cohesion; it had drawn its last breath; it was dead.
</p>

<p>Finally, a few days before the catastrophe, the extra-parliamentary mass of
the bourgeoisie was solemnly to confirm once more its breach with the
bourgeoisie in parliament. Thiers, as a parliamentary hero infected more than
the rest with the incurable disease of parliamentary cretinism, had, after the
death of parliament, hatched out, together with the Council of State, a new
parliamentary intrigue, a Responsibility Law by which the President was to be
firmly held within the limits of the constitution. Just as, on laying the
foundation stone of the new market halls in Paris on September 15, Bonaparte,
like a second Masaniello, had enchanted the <em>dames des balles</em>, the
fishwives - to be sure, one fishwife outweighed seventeen burgraves in real
power - just as after the introduction of the Quaestors' Bill he enraptured the
lieutenants whom he regaled in the Elysee, so now, on November 25, he swept off
their feet the industrial bourgeoisie, which had gathered at the circus to
receive at his hands prize medals for the London Industrial Exhibition. </p>

<p>I shall give the significant portion of his speech as reported in the
<i>Journal des Débats</i>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"'With such unhoped-for successes, I am justified in
reiterating how great the French Republic would be if it were permitted to
pursue its real interests and reform its institutions, instead of being
constantly disturbed by demagogues, on the one hand, and by monarchist
hallucinations, on the other.' (Loud, stormy and repeated applause from every
part of the amphitheater.) 'The monarchist hallucinations hinder all progress
and all important branches of industry. In place of progress nothing but
struggle. One sees men who were formerly the most zealous supporters of the
royal authority and prerogative become partisans of a Convention merely in
order to weaken the authority that has sprung from universal suffrage.' (Loud
and repeated applause.) 'We see men who have suffered most from the Revolution,
and have deplored it most, provoke a new one, and merely in order to fetter the
nation's will.... I promise you tranquillity for the future,' etc., etc.
(Bravo, bravo, a storm of bravos.) " </p>

<p>Thus the industrial bourgeoisie applauds with servile bravos the coup d'etat
of December 2, the annihilation of parliament, the downfall of its own rule,
the dictatorship of Bonaparte. The thunder of applause on November 25 had its
answer in the thunder of cannon on December 4,<sup class="enote"><a
href="notes.htm#n116">[116]</a></sup> and it was on the house of Monsieur
Sallandrouze, who had clapped most, that they clapped most of the bombs. </p>

<p><a name="cromwell"></a> Cromwell, when he dissolved the Long Parliament,
went alone into its midst, took out his watch so that it should not continue to
exist a minute after the time limit he had fixed, and drove out each one of the
members of Parliament with hilariously humorous taunts. Napoleon, smaller than
his prototype, at least betook himself on the eighteenth Brumaire to the
legislative body and read out to it, though in a faltering voice, its sentence
of death. The second Bonaparte, who, moreover, found himself in possession of
an executive power very different from that of Cromwell or Napoleon, sought his
model not in the annals of world history but in the annals of the Society of
December 10, in the annals of the criminal courts. He robs the Bank of France
of twenty-five million francs, buys General Magnan with a million, the soldiers
with fifteen francs apiece and liquor, comes together with his accomplices
secretly like a thief in the night, has the houses of the most dangerous
parliamentary leaders broken into, and Cavaignac, Lamoricière, Le Flô,
Changarnier, Charras, Thiers, Baze, etc., dragged from their beds and put in
prison, the chief squares of Paris and the parliamentary building occupied by
troops, and cheapjack placards posted early in the morning on all the walls,
proclaiming the dissolution of the National Assembly and the Council of State,
the restoration of universal suffrage, and the placing of the Seine Department
in a state of siege. In like manner he inserted a little later in the Moniteur
a false document which asserted that influential parliamentarians had grouped
themselves around him and formed a state consulta. </p>

<p>The rump parliament, assembled in the mairie building of the Tenth
Arrondissement and consisting mainly of Legitimists and Orleanists, votes the
deposition of Bonaparte amid repeated cries of "Long live the Republic,"
unfailingly harangues the gaping crowds before the building, and is finally led
off in the custody of African sharpshooters, first to the d'Orsay barracks, and
later packed into prison vans and transported to the prisons of Mazas, Ham, and
Vincennes. Thus ended the party of Order, the Legislative Assembly, and the
February Revolution.</p>
