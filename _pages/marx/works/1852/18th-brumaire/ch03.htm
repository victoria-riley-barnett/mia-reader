<p class="title">The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte. Karl Marx 1852</p>
<h1>III</h1>
<p class="fst">
On May 28, 1849, the Legislative National Assembly met. On December 2,
1851, it was dispersed. This period covers the span of life of the
constitutional, or parliamentary, republic.
</p>

<p>
In the first French Revolution the rule of the <em>Constitutionalists</em> is
followed by the rule of the <em>Girondists</em> and the rule of the Girondists
by the rule of the <em>Jacobins</em>. Each of these parties relies on the more
progressive party for support. As soon as it has brought the revolution
far enough to be unable to follow it further, still less to go ahead of
it, it is thrust aside by the bolder ally that stands behind it and
sent to the guillotine. The revolution thus moves along an ascending
line.
</p>

<p>
It is the reverse with the Revolution of 1848. The proletarian party
appears as an appendage of the petty-bourgeois-democratic party. It is
betrayed and dropped by the latter on April 16, May 15,<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.htm#n90">[90]</a></sup> and in the June
days. The democratic party, in its turn, leans on the shoulders of the
bourgeois-republican party. The bourgeois republicans no sooner believe
themselves well established than they shake off the troublesome comrade
and support themselves on the shoulders of the party of Order. The
party of Order hunches its shoulders, lets the bourgeois republicans
tumble, and throws itself on the shoulders of armed force. It fancies
it is still sitting on those shoulders when one fine morning it
perceives that the shoulders have transformed themselves into bayonets.
Each party kicks from behind at the one driving forward, and leans over
in front toward the party which presses backward. No wonder that in
this ridiculous posture it loses its balance and, having made the
inevitable grimaces, collapses with curious gyrations. The revolution
thus moves in a descending line. It finds itself in this state of
retrogressive motion before the last February barricade has been
cleared away and the first revolutionary authority constituted.
</p>

<p>
The period that we have before us comprises the most motley mixture of
crying contradictions: constitutionalists who conspire openly against
the constitution; revolutionists who are confessedly constitutional; a
National Assembly that wants to be omnipotent and always remains
parliamentary; a Montagne that finds its vocation in patience and
counters its present defeats by prophesying future victories; royalists
who form the <em>patres conscripti</em> <span class="context">[elders]</span>
of the republic and are forced
by the situation to keep the hostile royal houses they adhere to
abroad, and the republic, which they hate, in France; an executive
power that finds its strength in its very weakness and its
respectability in the contempt that it calls forth; a republic that is
nothing but the combined infamy of two monarchies, the Restoration and
the July Monarchy, with an imperial label &#8211; alliances whose first
proviso is separation; struggles whose first law is indecision; wild,
inane agitation in the name of tranquillity, most solemn preaching of
tranquillity in the name of revolution &#8211; passions without truth, truths
without passion; heroes without heroic deeds, history without events;
development, whose sole driving force seems to be the calendar,
wearying with constant repetition of the same tensions and relaxations;
antagonisms that periodically seem to work themselves up to a climax
only to lose their sharpness and fall away without being able to
resolve themselves; pretentiously paraded exertions and philistine
terror at the danger of the world&#8217;s coming to an end, and at the same
time the pettiest intrigues and court comedies played by the world
redeemers, who in their <em>laisser aller</em> <span class="context">[letting things go]</span> 
remind us less of the Day of Judgment than of the times of the
Fronde <span class="context">[An anti-royalist movement of 1648-53]</span><sup class="enote"><a href="notes.htm#n91">[91]</a></sup> &#8211; the official
collective genius of France brought to naught by the artful stupidity
of a single individual; the collective will of the nation, as often as
it speaks through universal suffrage, seeking its appropriate
expression through the inveterate enemies of the interests of the
masses, until at length it finds it in the self-will of a filibuster.
If any section of history has been painted gray on gray, it is this.
Men and events appear as reverse Schlemihls, as shadows that have lost
their bodies.<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.htm#n91a">[91a]</a></sup> The revolution itself paralyzes its own bearers and
endows only its adversaries with passionate forcefulness. When the &#8220;red
specter,&#8221; continually conjured up and exercised by the
counterrevolutionaries<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.htm#n92">[92]</a></sup> finally appears, it appears not with the
Phrygian cap of anarchy on its head, but in the uniform of order, in
<em>red breeches</em>.
</p>

<p>
We have seen that the ministry which Bonaparte installed on December
20, 1848, on his Ascension Day, was a ministry of the party of Order,
of the Legitimist and Orleanist coalition. This Barrot-Falloux Ministry
had outlived the republican Constituent Assembly, whose term of life it
had more or less violently cut short, and found itself still at the
helm. Changarnier, the general of the allied royalists, continued to
unite in his person the general command of the First Army Division and
of the National Guard of Paris. Finally, the general elections had
secured the party of Order a large majority in the National Assembly.
Here the deputies and peers of Louis Philippe encountered a hallowed
host of Legitimists, for whom many of the nation&#8217;s ballots had become
transformed into admission cards to the political stage. The
Bonapartist representatives of the people were too sparse to be able to
form an independent parliamentary party. They appeared merely as the
<em>mauvaise queue</em> <span class="context">[evil appendage]</span>
of the party of Order. Thus the party
of Order was in possession of the governmental power, the army and the
legislative body, in short, of the whole of the state power; it had
been morally strengthened by the general elections, which made its rule
appear as the will of the people, and by the simultaneous triumph of
the counterrevolution on the whole continent of Europe.
</p>

<p>
Never did a party open its campaign with greater resources or under
more favorable auspices.
</p>

<p>
The shipwrecked pure republicans found that they had melted down to a
clique of about fifty men in the Legislative National Assembly, the
African generals Cavaignac, Lamoriciere, and Bedeau at their head. The
great opposition party, however, was formed by the Montagne. The
social-democratic party had given itself this parliamentary baptismal
name. It commanded more than two hundred of the seven hundred and fifty
votes of the National Assembly and was consequently at least as
powerful as any one of the three factions of the party of Order taken
by itself. Its numerical inferiority compared with the entire royalist
coalition seemed compensated by special circumstances. Not only did the
elections in the departments show that it had gained a considerable
following among the rural population. It counted in its ranks almost
all the deputies from Paris; the army had made a confession of
democratic faith by the election of three noncommissioned officers; and
the leader of the Montagne, Ledru-Rollin, in contradistinction to all
the representatives of the party of Order, had been raised to the
parliamentary peerage by five departments, which had pooled their votes
for him. In view of the inevitable clashes of the royalists among
themselves and of the whole party of Order with Bonaparte, the Montagne
thus seemed to have all the elements of success before it on May 28,
1849. A fortnight later it had lost everything, honor included.
</p>

<p>
Before we pursue parliamentary history further, some remarks are
necessary to avoid common misconceptions regarding the whole character
of the epoch that lies before us. Looked at with the eyes of democrats,
the period of the Legislative National Assembly is concerned with what
the period of the Constituent Assembly was concerned with: the simple
struggle between republicans and royalists. The movement itself,
however, they sum up in the one shibboleth: &#8220;reaction&#8221; &#8211; night, in
which all cats are gray and which permits them to reel off their night
watchman&#8217;s commonplaces. And to be sure, at first sight the party of
Order reveals a maze of different royalist factions which not only
intrigue against each other &#8211; each seeking to elevate its own
pretender to the throne and exclude the pretender of the opposing
faction &#8211; but also all unite in common hatred of, and common
onslaughts on, the &#8220;republic.&#8221; In opposition to this royalist
conspiracy the Montagne, for its part, appears as the representative of
the &#8220;republic.&#8221; The party of Order appears to be perpetually engaged in
a &#8220;reaction,&#8221; directed against press, association, and the like,
neither more nor less than in Prussia, and, as in Prussia, carried out
in the form of brutal police intervention by the bureaucracy, the
gendarmerie, and the law courts. The Montagne, for its part, is just as
continually occupied in warding off these attacks and thus defending
the &#8220;eternal rights of man&#8221; as every so-called people&#8217;s party has done,
more or less, for a century and a half. If one looks at the situation
and the parties more closely, however, this superficial appearance,
which veils the class struggle and the peculiar physiognomy of this
period, disappears.
</p>

<p>
Legitimists and Orleanists, as we have said, formed the two great
factions of the party of Order. Was what held these factions fast to
their pretenders and kept them apart from each other nothing but
fleur-de-lis and tricolor, House of Bourbon and House of Orleans,
different shades of royalism &#8211; was it at all the confession of faith
of royalism? Under the Bourbons, big landed property had governed, with
its priests and lackeys; under Orleans, high finance, large-scale
industry, large-scale trade, that is, capital, with its retinue of
lawyers, professors, and smooth-tongued orators. The Legitimate
Monarchy was merely the political expression of the hereditary rule of
the lords of the soil, as the July Monarchy was only the political
expression of the usurped rule of the bourgeois parvenus. What kept the
two factions apart, therefore, was not any so-called principles, it was
their material conditions of existence, two different kinds of
property; it was the old contrast between town and country, the rivalry
between capital and landed property. That at the same time old
memories, personal enmities, fears and hopes, prejudices and illusions,
sympathies and antipathies, convictions, articles of faith and
principles bound them to one or the other royal house, who denies this?
Upon the different forms of property, upon the social conditions of
existence, rises an entire superstructure of distinct and peculiarly
formed sentiments, illusions, modes of thought, and views of life. The
entire class creates and forms them out of its material foundations and
out of the corresponding social relations. The single individual, who
derives them through tradition and upbringing, may imagine that they
form the real motives and the starting point of his activity. While
each faction, Orleanists and Legitimists, sought to make itself and the
other believe that it was loyalty to the two royal houses which
separated them, facts later proved that it was rather their divided
interests which forbade the uniting of the two royal houses. And as in
private life one differentiates between what a man thinks and says of
himself and what he really is and does, so in historical struggles one
must distinguish still more the phrases and fancies of parties from
their real organism and their real interests, their conception of
themselves from their reality. Orleanists and Legitimists found
themselves side by side in the republic, with equal claims. If each
side wished to effect the restoration of its own royal house against
the other, that merely signified that each of the two great interests
into which the bourgeoisie is split &#8211; landed property and capital -
sought to restore its own supremacy and the subordination of the other.
We speak of two interests of the bourgeoisie, for large landed
property, despite its feudal coquetry and pride of race, has been
rendered thoroughly bourgeois by the development of modern society.
Thus the Tories in England long imagined that they were enthusiastic
about monarchy, the church, and the beauties of the old English
Constitution, until the day of danger wrung from them the confession
that they are enthusiastic only about ground rent.
</p>

<p>
The royalists in coalition carried on their intrigues against one
another in the press, in Ems, in Claremont,<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.htm#n93">[93]</a></sup> outside parliament. Behind
the scenes they donned their old Orleanist and Legitimist liveries
again and once more engaged in their old tourneys. But on the public
stage, in their grand performances of state<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.htm#n94">[94]</a></sup> as a great parliamentary
party, they put off their respective royal houses with mere obeisances
and adjourn the restoration of the monarchy in infinitum. They do their
real business as the party of Order, that is, under a social, not under
a political title; as representatives of the bourgeois world order, not
as knights of errant princesses; as the bourgeois class against other
classes, not as royalists against the republicans. And as the party of
Order they exercised more unrestricted and sterner domination over the
other classes of society than ever previously under the Restoration or
under the July Monarchy, a domination which, in general, was possible
only under the form of the parliamentary republic, for only under this
form could the two great divisions of the French bourgeoisie unite, and
thus put the rule of their class instead of the regime of a privileged
faction of it on the order of the day. If they nevertheless, as the
party of Order, also insulted the republic and expressed their
repugnance to it, this happened not merely from royalist memories. 
Instinct taught them that the republic, true enough, makes their
political rule complete, but at the same time undermines its social
foundation, since they must now confront the subjugated classes and
contend against them without mediation, without the concealment
afforded by the crown, without being able to divert the national
interest by their subordinate struggles among themselves and with the
monarchy. It was a feeling of weakness that caused them to recoil from
the pure conditions of their own class rule and to yearn for the former
more incomplete, more undeveloped, and precisely on that account less
dangerous forms of this rule. On the other hand, every time the
royalists in coalition come in conflict with the pretender who
confronts them, with Bonaparte, every time they believe their
parliamentary omnipotence endangered by the executive power &#8211; every
time, therefore, that they must produce their political title to their
rule &#8211; they come forward as republicans and not as royalists, from the
Orleanist Thiers, who warns the National Assembly that the republic
divides them least, to the Legitimist Berryer, who on December 2, 1851,
as a tribune swathed in a tricolored sash, harangues the people
assembled before the town hall of the Tenth Arrondissement in the name
of the republic. To be sure, a mocking echo calls back to him: Henry V!
Henry V!
</p>

<p>
As against the coalesced bourgeoisie, a coalition between petty
bourgeois and workers had been formed, the so-called Social-Democratic
party. The petty bourgeois saw that they were badly rewarded after the
June days of 1848, that their material interests were imperiled, and
that the democratic guarantees which were to insure the effectuation of
these interests were called in question by the counterrevolution.
Accordingly they came closer to the workers. On the other hand, their
parliamentary representation, the Montagne, thrust aside during the
dictatorship of the bourgeois republicans, had in the last half of the
life of the Constituent Assembly reconquered its lost popularity
through the struggle with Bonaparte and the royalist ministers. It had
concluded an alliance with the socialist leaders. In February, 1849,
banquets celebrated the reconciliation. A joint program was drafted,
joint election committees were set up and joint candidates put forward.
The revolutionary point was broken off and a democratic turn given to
the social demands of the proletariat; the purely political form was
stripped off the democratic claims of the petty bourgeoisie and their
socialist point thrust forward. Thus arose social-democracy. The new
Montagne, the result of this combination, contained, apart from some
supernumeraries from the working class and some socialist sectarians,
the same elements as the old Montagne, but numerically stronger.
However, in the course of development it had changed with the class
that it represented. The peculiar character of social-democracy is
epitomized in the fact that democratic-republican institutions are
demanded as a means, not of doing away with two extremes, capital and
wage labor, but of weakening their antagonism and transforming it into
harmony. However different the means proposed for the attainment of
this end may be, however much it may be trimmed with more or less
revolutionary notions, the content remains the same. This content is
the transformation of society in a democratic way, but a transformation
within the bounds of the petty bourgeoisie. Only one must not get the
narrow-minded notion that the petty bourgeoisie, on principle, wishes
to enforce an egoistic class interest. Rather, it believes that the
special conditions of its emancipation are the general conditions
within whose frame alone modern society can be saved and the class
struggle avoided. Just as little must one imagine that the democratic
representatives are indeed all shopkeepers or enthusiastic champions of
shopkeepers. According to their education and their individual position
they may be as far apart as heaven and earth. What makes them
representatives of the petty bourgeoisie is the fact that in their
minds they do not get beyond the limits which the latter do not get
beyond in life, that they are consequently driven, theoretically, to
the same problems and solutions to which material interest and social
position drive the latter practically. This is, in general, the
relationship between the political and literary representatives of a
class and the class they represent.
</p>

<p>
After this analysis it is obvious that if the Montagne continually
contends with the party of Order for the republic and the so-called
rights of man, neither the republic nor the rights of man are its final
end, any more than an army which one wants to deprive of its weapons
and which resists has taken the field in order to remain in possession
of its own weapons.
</p>

<p>
Immediately, as soon as the National Assembly met, the party of Order
provoked the Montagne. The bourgeoisie now felt the necessity of making
an end of the democratic petty bourgeois, just as a year before it had
realized the necessity of settling with the revolutionary proletariat.
But the situation of the adversary was different. The strength of the
proletarian party lay in the streets, that of the petty bourgeois in
the National Assembly itself. It was therefore a question of decoying
them out of the National Assembly into the streets and causing them to
smash their parliamentary power themselves, before time and
circumstances could consolidate it. The Montagne rushed headlong into
the trap.
</p>

<p>
The bombardment of Rome by the French troops was the bait that was
thrown. It violated Article 5 of the constitution, which forbids the
French Republic to employ its military forces against the freedom of
another people.<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.htm#n95">[95]</a></sup> In addition to this, Article 54 prohibited any
declaration of war by the executive power without the assent of the
National Assembly, and by its resolution of May 8 the Constituent
Assembly had disapproved of the Roman expedition. On these grounds
Ledru-Rollin brought in a bill of impeachment against Bonaparte and his
ministers on June 11, 1849. Exasperated by the wasp stings of Thiers,
he actually let himself be carried away to the point of threatening
that he would defend the constitution by every means, even with arms in
hand. The Montagne rose to a man and repeated this call to arms. On
June 12 the National Assembly rejected the bill of impeachment, and the
Montagne left the parliament. The events of June 13 are known: the
proclamation issued by a section of the Montagne declaring Bonaparte
and his ministers &#8220;outside the constitution&#8221;; the street procession of
the democratic National Guard, who, unarmed as they were, dispersed on
encountering the troops of Changarnier, etc., etc. A part of the
Montagne fled abroad; another part was arraigned before the High Court
at Bourges;<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.htm#n96">[96]</a></sup> and a parliamentary regulation subjected the remainder to
the schoolmasterly surveillance of the President of the National
Assembly. Paris was again declared in a state of siege and the
democratic part of its National Guard dissolved. Thus the influence of
the Montagne in parliament and the power of the petty bourgeois in
Paris were broken.
</p>

<p>
Lyon, where June 13 had given the signal for a bloody insurrection of
the workers,<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.htm#n97">[97]</a></sup> was, along with the five surrounding departments, likewise
declared in a state of siege, a condition that has continued up to the
present moment.
</p>

<p>
The bulk of the Montagne had left its vanguard in the lurch, having
refused to subscribe to its proclamation. The press had deserted, only
two journals having dared to publish the pronunciamento. The petty
bourgeois betrayed their representatives in that the National Guard
either stayed away or, where they appeared, hindered the building of
barricades. The representatives had duped the petty bourgeois in that
the alleged allies from the army were nowhere to be seen. Finally,
instead of gaining an accession of strength from it, the democratic
party had infected the proletariat with its own weakness and, as usual
with the great deeds of democrats, the leaders had the satisfaction of
being able to charge their &#8220;people&#8221; with desertion, and the people the
satisfaction of being able to charge its leaders with humbugging it.
</p>

<p>
Seldom had an action been announced with more noise than the impending
campaign of the Montagne, seldom had an event been trumpeted with
greater certainty or longer in advance than the inevitable victory of
the democracy. Most assuredly the democrats believe in the trumpets
before whose blasts the walls of Jericho fell down. And as often as
they stand before the ramparts of despotism, they seek to imitate the
miracle. If the Montagne wished to triumph in parliament it should not
have called to arms. If it called to arms in parliament it should not
have acted in parliamentary fashion in the streets. If the peaceful
demonstration was meant seriously, then it was folly not to foresee
that it would be given a warlike reception. If a real struggle was
intended, then it was a queer idea to lay down the weapons with which
it would have to be waged. But the revolutionary threats of the petty
bourgeois and their democratic representatives are mere attempts to
intimidate the antagonist. And when they have run into a blind alley,
when they have sufficiently compromised themselves to make it necessary
to activate their threats, then this is done in an ambiguous fashion
that avoids nothing so much as the means to the end and tries to find
excuses for succumbing. The blaring overture that announced the contest
dies away in a pusillanimous snarl as soon as the struggle has to
begin, the actors cease to take themselves <em>au sorieux</em>, and the action
collapses completely, like a pricked bubble.
</p>

<p>
No party exaggerates its means more than the democratic, none deludes
itself more light-mindedly over the situation. Since a section of the
army had voted for it, the Montagne was now convinced that the army
would revolt for it. And on what occasion? On an occasion which, from
the standpoint of the troops, had no other meaning than that the
revolutionists took the side of the Roman soldiers against the French
soldiers. On the other hand, the recollections of June, 1848, were
still too fresh to allow of anything but a profound aversion on the
part of the proletariat toward the National Guard and a thoroughgoing
mistrust of the democratic chiefs on the part of the chiefs of the
secret societies. To iron out these differences, it was necessary for
great common interests to be at stake. The violation of an abstract
paragraph of the constitution could not provide these interests. Had
not the constitution been repeatedly violated, according to the
assurance of the democrats themselves? Had not the most popular
journals branded it as counterrevolutionary botchwork? But the
democrat, because he represents the petty bourgeoisie &#8211; that is, a
transition class, in which the interests of two classes are
simultaneously mutually blunted &#8211; imagines himself elevated above
class antagonism generally. The democrats concede that a privileged
class confronts them, but they, along with all the rest of the nation,
form the people. What they represent is the people&#8217;s rights; what
interests them is the people&#8217;s interests. Accordingly, when a struggle
is impending they do not need to examine the interests and positions of
the different classes. They do not need to weigh their own resources
too critically. They have merely to give the signal and the people,
with all its inexhaustible resources, will fall upon the oppressors.
Now if in the performance their interests prove to be uninteresting and
their potency impotence, then either the fault lies with pernicious
sophists, who split the indivisible people into different hostile
camps, or the army was too brutalized and blinded to comprehend that
the pure aims of democracy are the best thing for it, or the whole
thing has been wrecked by a detail in its execution, or else an
unforeseen accident has this time spoiled the game. In any case, the
democrat comes out of the most disgraceful defeat just as immaculate as
he was innocent when he went into it, with the newly won conviction
that he is bound to win, not that he himself and his party have to give
up the old standpoint, but, on the contrary, that conditions have to
ripen to suit him.
</p>

<p>
Therefore one must not imagine the Montagne, decimated and broken
though it was, and humiliated by the new parliamentary regulation, as
being particularly miserable. If June 13 had removed its chiefs, it
made room, on the other hand, for men of lesser caliber, whom this new
position flattered. If their impotence in parliament could no longer be
doubted, they were entitled now to confine their actions to outbursts
of moral indignation and blustering declamation. If the party of Order
affected to see embodied in them, as the last official representatives
of the revolution, all the terrors of anarchy, they could in reality be
all the more insipid and modest. They consoled themselves, however, for
June 13 with the profound utterance: but if they dare to attack
universal suffrage, well then &#8211; then we&#8217;ll show them what we are made
of! <em>Nous verrons!</em> <span class="context">[We shall see!]</span>
</p>

<p>
So far as the Montagnards who fled abroad are concerned, it is
sufficient to remark here that Ledru-Rollin, because in barely a
fortnight he had succeeded in ruining irretrievably the powerful party
at whose head he stood, now found himself called upon to form a French
government in partibus; that to the extent that the level of the
revolution sank and the official bigwigs of official France became more
dwarf-like, his figure in the distance, removed from the scene of
action, seemed to grow in stature; that he could figure as the
republican pretender for 1852, and that he issued periodical circulars
to the Wallachians and other peoples in which the despots of the
Continent were threatened with the deeds of himself and his
confederates. Was Proudhon altogether wrong when he cried to these
gentlemen: &#8220;<em>Vous n&#8217;etes que des blagueurs</em>&#8221; 
<span class="context">["you are nothing but windbags"]</span>?
</p>

<p>
On June 13 the party of Order had not only broken the Montagne, it had
effected the subordination of the constitution to the majority
decisions of the National Assembly. And it understood the republic
thus: that the bourgeoisie rules here in parliamentary forms, without,
as in a monarchy, encountering any barrier such as the veto power of
the executive or the right to dissolve parliament. This was a
parliamentary republic, as Thiers termed it. But whereas on June 13 the
bourgeoisie secured its omnipotence within the house of parliament, did
it not afflict parliament itself, as against the executive authority
and the people, with incurable weakness by expelling its most popular
part? By surrendering numerous deputies without further ado on the
demand of the courts, it abolished its own parliamentary immunity. The
humiliating regulations to which it subjected the Montagne exalted the
President of the Republic in the same measure as it degraded the
individual representatives of the people. By branding an insurrection
for the protection of the constitutional charter an anarchic act aiming
at the subversion of society, it precluded the possibility of its
appealing to insurrection should the executive authority violate the
constitution in relation to it. And by the irony of history, the
general who on Bonaparte&#8217;s instructions bombarded Rome and thus
provided the immediate occasion for the constitutional revolt of June
13, that very Oudinot had to be the man offered by the party of Order
imploringly and unfailingly to the people as general on behalf of the
constitution against Bonaparte on December 2, 1851. Another hero of
June 13, Vieyra, who was lauded from the tribune of the National
Assembly for the brutalities he committed in the democratic newspaper
offices at the head of a gang of National Guards belonging to high
finance circles &#8211; this same Vieyra had been initiated into Bonaparte&#8217;s
conspiracy and he contributed substantially to depriving the National
Assembly in the hour of its death of any protection by the National
Guard.
</p>

<p>
June 13 had still another meaning. The Montagne had wanted to force the
impeachment of Bonaparte. Its defeat was therefore a direct victory for
Bonaparte, his personal triumph over his democratic enemies. The party
of Order gained the victory; Bonaparte had only to cash in on it. He
did so. On June 14 a proclamation could be read on the walls of Paris
in which the President, reluctantly, against his will, compelled as it
were by the sheer force of events, comes forth from his cloistered
seclusion and, posing as misunderstood virtue, complains of the
calumnies of his opponents and, while he seems to identify his person
with the cause of order, rather identifies the cause of order with his
person. Moreover, the National Assembly had, it is true, subsequently
approved the expedition against Rome, but Bonaparte had taken the
initiative in the matter. After having reinstalled the High Priest
Samuel in the Vatican, he could hope to enter the Tuileries as King
David.<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.htm#n98">[98]</a></sup> He had won the priests over to his side.
</p>

<p>
The revolt of June 13 was confined, as we have seen, to a peaceful
street procession. No war laurels were therefore to be won against it.
Nevertheless, at a time as poor as this in heroes and events, the party
of Order transformed this bloodless battle into a second Austerlitz.<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.htm#n99">[99]</a></sup>
Platform and press praised the army as the power of order, in contrast
to the popular masses representing the impotence of anarchy, and
extolled Changarnier as the &#8220;bulwark of society,&#8221; a deception in which
he himself finally came to believe. Surreptitiously, however, the
corps that seemed doubtful were transferred from Paris, the regiments
which had shown the most democratic sentiments in the elections were
banished from France to Algiers; the turbulent spirits among the troops
were relegated to penal detachments; and finally the isolation of the
press from the barracks and of the barracks from bourgeois society was
systematically carried out.

Here we have reached the decisive turning point in the history of the
French National Guard. In 1830 it was decisive in the overthrow of the
Restoration. Under Louis Philippe every rebellion miscarried in which
the National Guard stood on the side of the troops. When in the
February days of 1848 it evinced a passive attitude toward the
insurrection and an equivocal one toward Louis Philippe, he gave
himself up for lost and actually was lost. Thus the conviction took
root that the revolution could not be victorious without the National
Guard, nor the army against it. This was the superstition of the army
in regard to civilian omnipotence. The June days of 1848, when the
entire National Guard, with the troops of the line, put down the
insurrection, had strengthened the superstition. After Bonaparte&#8217;s
assumption of office, the position of the National Guard was to some
extent weakened by the unconstitutional union, in the person of
Changarnier, of the command of its forces with the command of the First
Army Division.

Just as the command of the National Guard appeared here as an attribute
of the military commander in chief, so the National Guard itself
appeared as only an appendage of the troops of the line. Finally, on
June 13 its power was broken, and not only by its partial disbandment,
which from this time on was periodically repeated all over France,
until mere fragments of it were left behind. The demonstration of June
13 was, above all, a demonstration of the democratic National Guards.
They had not, to be sure, borne their arms, but had worn their uniforms
against the army; precisely in this uniform, however, lay the talisman.
The army convinced itself that this uniform was a piece of woolen cloth
like any other. The spell was broken. In the June days of 1848,
bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie had united as the National Guard with
the army against the proletariat; on June 13, 1849, the bourgeoisie let
the petty-bourgeois National Guard be dispersed by the army; on
December 2, 1851, the National Guard of the bourgeoisie itself had
vanished, and Bonaparte merely registered this fact when he
subsequently signed the decree for its disbandment, Thus the
bourgeoisie had itself smashed its last weapon against the army; the
moment the petty bourgeoisie no longer stood behind it as a vassal, but
before it as a rebel, it had to smash it as in general it was bound to
destroy all its means of defense against absolutism with its own hand
as soon as it had itself become absolute.

Meanwhile, the party of Order celebrated the reconquest of a power that
seemed lost in 1848 only to be found again, freed from its restraints,
in 1849, celebrated by means of invectives against the republic and the
constitution, of curses on all future, present, and past revolutions,
including that which its own leaders had made, and in laws by which the
press was muzzled, association destroyed, and the state of siege
regulated as an organic institution. The National Assembly then
adjourned from the middle of August to the middle of October, after
having appointed a permanent commission for the period of its absence. 
During this recess the Legitimists intrigued with Ems, the Orleanists
with Claremont, Bonaparte by means of princely tours, and the
Departmental Councils in deliberations on a revision of the
constitution: incidents which regularly recur in the periodic recesses
of the National Assembly and which I propose to discuss only when they
become events. Here it may merely be remarked, in addition, that it was
impolitic for the National Assembly to disappear from the stage for
considerable intervals and leave only a single, albeit a sorry, figure
to be seen at the head of the republic, that of Louis Bonaparte, while
to the scandal of the public the party of Order fell asunder into its
royalist component parts and followed its conflicting desires for
restoration. As often as the confused noise of parliament grew silent
during these recesses and its body dissolved into the nation, it became
unmistakably clear that only one thing was still lacking to complete
the true form of this republic: to make the former&#8217;s recess permanent
and replace the latter&#8217;s inscription, Libert&eacute;, Egalit&eacute;, Fraternit&eacute;,
with the unambiguous words: infantry, cavalry, artillery!
