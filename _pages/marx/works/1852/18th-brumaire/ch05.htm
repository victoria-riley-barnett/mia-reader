<p class="title">The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte. 1852</p>

<h1>V</h1>

<p class="fst">As soon as the revolutionary crisis had been weathered and
universal suffrage abolished, the struggle between the National Assembly and
Bonaparte broke out again. </p>

<p>The constitution had fixed Bonaparte's salary at 600,000 francs. Barely six
months after his installation he succeeded in increasing this sum to twice as
much, for Odilon Barrot wrung from the Constituent National Assembly an extra
allowance of 600,000 francs a year for so-called representation moneys. After
June 13 Bonaparte had caused similar requests to be voiced, this time without
eliciting response from Barrot. Now, after May 31, he at once availed himself
of the favorable moment and had his ministers propose a Civil List of three
millions in the National Assembly. A long life of adventurous vagabondage had
endowed him with the most developed antennae for feeling out the weak moments
when he might squeeze money from his bourgeois. He practiced <em>chantage</em>
<span class="context">[blackmail]</span> regularly. The National Assembly had
violated the sovereignty of the people with his assistance and his cognizance.
He threatened to denounce its crime to the tribunal of the people unless it
loosened its purse strings and purchased his silence with three million a year.
It had robbed three million Frenchmen of their franchise. He demanded, for
every Frenchman out of circulation, a franc in circulation, precisely three
million francs. He, the elect of six millions, claimed damages for the votes
which he said he had retrospectively been cheated out of. The Commission of the
National Assembly refused the importunate man. The Bonapartist press
threatened. Could the National Assembly break with the President of the
Republic at a moment when in principle it had definitely broken with the mass
of the nation? It rejected the annual Civil List, it is true, but it granted,
for this once, an extra allowance of 2,160,000 francs. It thus rendered itself
guilty of the double weakness of granting the money and of showing at the same
time by its vexation that it granted it unwillingly. We shall see later for
what purpose Bonaparte needed the money. After this vexatious aftermath, which
followed on the heels of the abolition of universal suffrage and in which
Bonaparte exchanged his humble attitude during the crisis of March and April
for challenging impudence to the usurpatory parliament, the National Assembly
adjourned for three months, from August 11 to November 11. In its place it left
behind a Permanent Commission of twenty-eight members, which contained no
Bonapartists but did contain some moderate republicans. The Permanent
Commission of 1849 had included only Order men and Bonapartists. But at that
time the party of Order declared itself permanently against the revolution.
This time the parliamentary republic declared itself permanently against the
President. After the law of May 31, this was the only rival that still
confronted the party of Order. </p>

<p>When the National Assembly met once more in November, 1850, it seemed that,
instead of the petty skirmishes it had hitherto had with the President, a great
and ruthless struggle, a life-and-death struggle between the two powers, had
become inevitable. </p>

<p>As in 1849 so during this year's parliamentary recess &mdash; the party of
Order had broken up into its separate factions, each occupied with its own
restoration intrigues, which had obtained fresh nutriment through the death of
Louis Philippe. The Legitimist king, Henry V, had even nominated a formal
ministry which resided in Paris and in which members of the Permanent
Commission held seats. Bonaparte, in his turn, was therefore entitled to make
tours of the French departments, and according to the disposition of the town
he favored with his presence, now more or less covertly, now more or less
overtly, to divulge his own restoration plans and canvass votes for himself. On
these processions, which the great official Moniteur and the little private
Moniteurs of Bonaparte naturally had to celebrate as triumphal processions, he
was constantly accompanied by persons affiliated with the Society of December
10. This society dates from the year 1849. On the pretext of founding a
benevolent society, the lumpen proletariat of Paris had been organized into
secret sections, each section led by Bonapartist agents, with a Bonapartist
general at the head of the whole. Alongside decayed roués with dubious means of
subsistence and of dubious origin, alongside ruined and adventurous offshoots
of the bourgeoisie, were vagabonds, discharged soldiers, discharged jailbirds,
escaped galley slaves, swindlers, mountebanks, lazzaroni,<sup class="enote"><a
href="notes.htm#n105">[105]</a></sup> pickpockets, tricksters, gamblers,
<em>maquereaux</em> <span class="context">[pimps]</span>, brothel keepers,
porters, literati, organ grinders, ragpickers, knife grinders, tinkers, beggars
&mdash; in short, the whole indefinite, disintegrated mass, thrown hither and
thither, which the French call <i>la bohème</i>; from this kindred element
Bonaparte formed the core of the Society of December 10. A "benevolent society"
- insofar as, like Bonaparte, all its members felt the need of benefiting
themselves at the expense of the laboring nation. This Bonaparte, who
constitutes himself <i>chief of the lumpenproletariat</i>, who here alone
rediscovers in mass form the interests which he personally pursues, who
recognizes in this scum, offal, refuse of all classes the only class upon which
he can base himself unconditionally, is the real Bonaparte, the Bonaparte
<i>sans phrase</i>. An old, crafty <i>roué</i>, he conceives the historical
life of the nations and their performances of state as comedy in the most
vulgar sense, as a masquerade in which the grand costumes, words, and postures
merely serve to mask the pettiest knavery. Thus his expedition to Strasbourg,
where the trained Swiss vulture played the part of the Napoleonic eagle. For
his irruption into Boulogne he puts some London lackeys into French uniforms.
They represent the army.<sup class="enote"><a
href="notes.htm#n107">[107]</a></sup> In his Society of December 10 he
assembles ten thousand rascals who are to play the part of the people as Nick
Bottom <span class="context">[A character in Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's
Dream. - Ed.]</span> that of the lion. At a moment when the bourgeoisie itself
played the most complete comedy, but in the most serious manner in the world,
without infringing any of the pedantic conditions of French dramatic etiquette,
and was itself half deceived, half convinced of the solemnity of its own
performance of state, the adventurer, who took the comedy as plain comedy, was
bound to win. Only when he has eliminated his solemn opponent, when he himself
now takes his imperial role seriously and under the Napoleonic mask imagines he
is the real Napoleon, does he become the victim of his own conception of the
world, the serious buffoon who no longer takes world history for a comedy but
his comedy for world history. What the national <i>ateliers</i><sup
class="enote"><a href="notes.htm#n108">[108]</a></sup> were for the socialist
workers, what the <em>Gardes mobile</em> were for the bourgeois republicans,
the Society of December 10 was for Bonaparte, the party fighting force peculiar
to him. On his journeys the detachments of this society packing the railways
had to improvise a public for him, stage popular enthusiasm, roar <em>Vive
l'Empereur</em>, insult and thrash republicans, under police protection, of
course. On his return journeys to Paris they had to form the advance guard,
forestall counter-demonstrations or disperse them. The Society of December 10
belonged to him, it was <i>his</i> work, his very own idea. Whatever else he
appropriates is put into his hands by the force of circumstances; whatever else
he does, the circumstances do for him or he is content to copy from the deeds
of others. But Bonaparte with official phrases about order, religion, family,
and property in public, before the citizens, and with the secret society of the
Schufterles and Spiegelbergs<sup class="enote"><a
href="notes.htm#n108a">[108a]</a></sup>, the society of disorder, prostitution,
and theft, behind him &mdash; that is Bonaparte himself as the original author,
and the history of the Society of December 10 is his own history. </p>

<p>Now it had happened by way of exception that people's representatives
belonging to the party of Order came under the cudgels of the Decembrists.
Still more. Yon, the police commissioner assigned to the National Assembly and
charged with watching over its safety, acting on the deposition of a certain
Allais, advised the Permanent Commission that a section of the Decembrists had
decided to assassinate General Changarnier and Dupin, the President of the
National Assembly, and had already designated the individuals who were to
perpetrate the deed. One comprehends the terror of M. Dupin. A parliamentary
inquiry into the Society of December 10 &mdash; that is, the profanation of the
Bonapartist secret world &mdash; seemed inevitable. Just before the meeting of
the National Assembly Bonaparte providently disbanded his society, naturally
only on paper, for in a detailed memoir at the end of 1851 Police Prefect
Carlier still sought in vain to move him to really break up the Decembrists.
</p>

<p>The Society of December 10 was to remain the private army of Bonaparte until
he succeeded in transforming the public army into a Society of December 10.
Bonaparte made the first attempt at this shortly after the adjournment of the
National Assembly, and precisely with the money just wrested from it. As a
fatalist, he lives in the conviction that there are certain higher powers which
man, and the soldier in particular, cannot withstand. Among these powers he
counts, first and foremost, cigars and champagne, cold poultry and garlic
sausage. Accordingly, to begin with, he treats officers and non-commissioned
officers in his Elysée apartments to cigars and champagne, cold poultry and
garlic sausage. On October 3 he repeats this maneuver with the mass of the
troops at the St. Maur review, and on October 10 the same maneuver on a still
larger scale at the Satory army parade. The uncle remembered the campaigns of
Alexander in Asia, the nephew the triumphal marches of Bacchus in the same
land. Alexander was a demigod, to be sure, but Bacchus was a god and moreover
the tutelary deity of the Society of December 10. </p>

<p>After the review of October 3, the Permanent Commission summoned War
Minister Hautpoul. He promised that these breaches of discipline would not
recur. We know how on October 10 Bonaparte kept Hautpoul's word. As commander
in chief of the Paris army, Changarnier had commanded at both reviews. At once
a member of the Permanent Commission, chief of the National Guard, the "savior"
of January 29 and June 13, the "bulwark of society," the candidate of the party
of Order for presidential honors, the suspected monk of two monarchies, he had
hitherto never acknowledged himself as the subordinate of the War Minister, had
always openly derided the republican constitution, and had pursued Bonaparte
with an ambiguous lordly protection. Now he was consumed with zeal for
discipline against the War Minister and for the constitution against Bonaparte.
While on October 10 a section of the cavalry raised the shout: "<em>Vive
Napoléon! Vivent les saucissons!</em>" <span class="context">[Hurrah for
Napoléon! Hurrah for the sausages!]</span> Changarnier arranged that at least
the infantry marching past under the command of his friend Neumayer should
preserve an icy silence. As a punishment, the War Minister relieved General
Neumayer of his post in Paris at Bonaparte's instigation, on the pretext of
appointing him commanding general of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth divisions.
Neumayer refused this exchange of posts and so had to resign. Changarnier, for
his part, published an order of the day on November 2 in which he forbade the
troops to indulge in political outcries or demonstrations of any kind while
under arms. The Elysee newspapers attacked Changarnier; the papers of the party
of Order attacked Bonaparte; the Permanent Commission held repeated secret
sessions in which it was repeatedly proposed to declare the country in danger;
the army seemed divided into two hostile camps, with two hostile general
staffs, one in the Elysée, where Bonaparte resided, the other in the Tuileries,
the quarters of Changarnier. It seemed that only the meeting of the National
Assembly was needed to give the signal for battle. The French public judged
this friction between Bonaparte and Changarnier like the English journalist who
characterized it in these words:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The political housemaids of France are sweeping away the
glowing lava of the revolution with old brooms and wrangle with one another
while they do their work." </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bonaparte hastened to remove the War Minister Hautpoul, to pack
him off in all haste to Algiers, and to appoint General Schramm War Minister in
his place. On November 12 he sent to the National Assembly a message of
American prolixity, overloaded with detail, redolent of order, desirous of
reconciliation, constitutionally acquiescent, treating of all and sundry, but
not of the <em>questions brûlantes</em> <span class="context">[burning
questions]</span> of the moment. As if in passing, he made the remark that
according to the express provisions of the constitution the President alone
could dispose of the army. The message closed with the following words of great
solemnity: </p>

<p class="quoteb">"<em>Above all things, France demands tranquillity.... But
bound by an oath, I shall keep within the narrow limits that it has set for
me....</em> As far as I am concerned, elected by the people and owing my power
to it alone, I shall always bow to its lawfully expressed will. Should you
resolve at this session on a revision of the constitution, a Constituent
Assembly will regulate the position of the executive power. If not, then the
people will solemnly pronounce its decision in 1852. But whatever the solutions
of the future may be, let us come to an understanding, so that passion,
surprise, or violence may never decide the destiny of a great nation.... What
occupies my attention, above all, is not who will rule France in 1852, but how
to employ the time which remains at my disposal so that the intervening period
may pass by without agitation or disturbance. I have opened my heart to you
with sincerity; you will answer my frankness with your trust, my good endeavors
with your cooperation, and God will do the rest." </p>

<p>The respectable, hypocritically moderate, virtuously commonplace language of
the bourgeoisie reveals its deepest meaning in the mouth of the autocrat of the
Society of December 10 and the picnic hero of St. Maur and Satory. </p>

<p>The burgraves of the party of Order did not delude themselves for a moment
concerning the trust that this opening of the heart deserved. About oaths they
had long been blasé they numbered in their midst veterans and virtuosos of
political perjury. Nor had they failed to hear the passage about the army. They
observed with annoyance that in its discursive enumeration of lately enacted
laws the message passed over the most important law, the electoral law, in
studied silence, and moreover, in the event of there being no revision of the
constitution, left the election of the President in 1852 to the people. The
electoral law was the lead ball chained to the feet of the party of Order,
which prevented it from walking and so much the more from storming forward!
Moreover, by the official disbandment of the Society of December 10 and the
dismissal of War Minister Hautpoul, Bonaparte had with his own hand sacrificed
the scapegoats on the altar of the country. He had blunted the edge of the
expected collision. Finally, the party of Order itself anxiously sought to
avoid, to mitigate, to gloss over any decisive conflict with the executive
power. For fear of losing their conquests over the revolution, they allowed
their rival to carry off the fruits thereof. "Above all things, France demands
tranquillity." This was what the party of Order had cried to the revolution
since February [1848], this was what Bonaparte's message cried to the party of
Order. "Above all things, France demands tranquillity." Bonaparte committed
acts that aimed at usurpation, but the party of Order committed "unrest" if it
raised a row about these acts and construed them hypochondriacally. The
sausages of Satory were quiet as mice when no one spoke of them. "Above all
things, France demands tranquillity." Bonaparte demanded, therefore, that he be
left in peace to do as he liked and the parliamentary party was paralyzed by a
double fear, the fear of again evoking revolutionary unrest and the fear of
itself appearing as the instigator of unrest in the eyes of its own class, in
the eyes of the bourgeoisie. Consequently, since France demanded tranquillity
above all things, the party of Order dared not answer "war" after Bonaparte had
talked "peace" in his message. The public, which had anticipated scenes of
great scandal at the opening of the National Assembly, was cheated of its
expectations. The opposition deputies, who demanded the submission of the
Permanent Commission's minutes on the October events, were out-voted by the
majority. On principle, all debates that might cause excitement were eschewed.
The proceedings of the National Assembly during November and December, 1850,
were without interest. </p>

<p>At last, toward the end of December, guerrilla warfare began over a number
of prerogatives of parliament. The movement got bogged down in petty squabbles
about the prerogatives of the two powers, since the bourgeoisie had done away
with the class struggle for the moment by abolishing universal suffrage. </p>

<p>A judgment for debt had been obtained from the court against Mauguin, one of
the people's representatives. In answer to the inquiry of the president of the
court, the Minister of Justice, Rouher, declared that a <i>capias</i> should be
issued against the debtor without further ado. Mauguin was thus thrown into
debtors' prison. The National Assembly flared up when it learned of the
assault. Not only did it order his immediate release, but it even had him
fetched forcibly from Clichy the same evening, by its clerk. In order, however,
to confirm its faith in the sanctity of private property and with the idea at
the back of its mind of opening, in case of need, a place of safekeeping for
Montagnards who had become troublesome, it declared imprisonment of people's
representatives for debt permissible when its consent had been previously
obtained. It forgot to decree that the President might also be locked up for
debt. It destroyed the last semblance of the immunity that enveloped the
members of its own body. </p>

<p>It will be remembered that, acting on the information given by a certain
Allais, Police Commissioner Yon had denounced a section of the Decembrists for
planning the murders of Dupin and Changarnier. In reference to this, at the
very first session the quaestors made the proposal that parliament should form
a police force of its own, paid out of the private budget of the National
Assembly and absolutely independent of the police prefect. The Minister of the
Interior, Baroche, protested against this invasion of his domain. A miserable
compromise on this matter was concluded, according to which, true, the police
commissioner of the Assembly was to be paid out of its private budget and to be
appointed and dismissed by its quaestors, but only after previous agreement
with the Minister of the Interior. Meanwhile the government had started
criminal proceedings against Alais, and here it was easy to represent his
information as a hoax and through the mouth of the public prosecutor to cast
ridicule upon Dupin, Changarnier, Yon, and the whole National Assembly.
Thereupon, on December 29, Minister Baroche writes a letter to Dupin in which
he demands Yon's dismissal. The bureau of the Assembly, alarmed by its violence
in the Mauguin affair and accustomed when it has ventured a blow at the
executive power to receive two blows from it in return, does not sanction this
decision. It dismisses Yon as a reward for his official zeal and robs itself of
a parliamentary prerogative indispensable against a man who does not decide by
night in order to execute by day, but decides by day and executes by night. </p>

<p>We have seen how on great and striking occasions during the months of
November and December the National Assembly avoided or quashed the struggle
with the executive power. Now we see it compelled to take up the struggle on
the pettiest occasions. In the Mauguin affair it confirms the principle of
imprisoning people's representatives for debt, but reserves the right to have
it applied only to representatives obnoxious to itself and wrangles over this
infamous privilege with the Minister of Justice. Instead of availing itself of
the alleged murder plot to decree an inquiry into the Society of December 10
and irredeemably unmasking Bonaparte before France and Europe in his true
character of chief of the Paris lumpen proletariat, it lets the conflict be
degraded to a point where the only issue between it and the Minister of the
Interior is which of them has the authority to appoint and dismiss a police
commissioner. Thus during the whole of this period we see the party of Order
compelled by its equivocal position to dissipate and disintegrate its struggle
with the executive power in petty jurisdictional squabbles, pettifoggery,
legalistic hairsplitting, and delimitational disputes, and to make the most
ridiculous matters of form the substance of its activity. It does not dare take
up the conflict at the moment when this has significance from the standpoint of
principle, when the executive power has really exposed itself and the cause of
the National Assembly would be the cause of the nation. By so doing it would
give the nation its marching orders, and it fears nothing more than that the
nation should move. On such occasions it accordingly rejects the motions of the
Montagne and proceeds to the order of the day. The question at issue in its
large aspects having thus been dropped, the executive power calmly waits for
the time when it can again take up the same question on petty and insignificant
occasions, when this is, so to speak, of only local parliamentary interest.
Then the repressed rage of the party of Order breaks out, then it tears the
curtain away from the coulisses, then it denounces the President, then it
declares the republic in danger, but then, also, its fervor appears absurd and
the occasion for the struggle seems a hypocritical pretext or altogether not
worth fighting about. The parliamentary storm becomes a storm in a teacup, the
fight becomes an intrigue, the conflict a scandal. While the revolutionary
classes gloat with malicious joy over the humiliation of the National Assembly,
for they are just as enthusiastic about the parliamentary prerogatives of this
Assembly as the latter is about the public liberties, the bourgeoisie outside
parliament does not understand how the bourgeoisie inside parliament can waste
time over such petty squabbles and imperil tranquillity by such pitiful
rivalries with the President. It becomes confused by a strategy that makes
peace at the moment when all the world is expecting battles, and attacks at the
moment when all the world believes peace has been made. </p>

<p>On December 20 Pascal Duprat interpellated the Minister of the Interior
concerning the Gold Bars Lottery. This lottery was a "daughter of Elysium."
Bonaparte with his faithful followers had brought her into the world and Police
Prefect Carlier had placed her under his official protection, although French
law forbids all lotteries except raffles for charitable purposes. Seven million
lottery tickets at a franc-a-piece, the profits ostensibly to be devoted to
shipping Parisian vagabonds to California. On the one hand, golden dreams were
to supplant the socialist dreams of the Paris proletariat, the seductive
prospect of the first prize the doctrinaire right to work. Naturally the Paris
workers did not recognize in the glitter of the California gold bars the
inconspicuous francs that were enticed out of their pockets. In the main,
however, the matter was nothing short of a downright swindle. The vagabonds who
wanted to open California gold mines without troubling to leave Paris were
Bonaparte himself and his debt-ridden Round Table. The three millions voted by
the National Assembly had been squandered in riotous living; in one way or
another coffers had to be replenished. In vain had Bonaparte opened a national
subscription for the building of so-called <em>cites ouvrieres</em> <span
class="context">[workers' cities]</span>, and headed the list himself with a
considerable sum. The hard-hearted bourgeois waited mistrustfully for him to
pay up his share, and since this naturally did not ensue, the speculation in
socialist castles in the air immediately fell to the ground. The gold bars
proved a better draw. Bonaparte &amp; Co. were not content to pocket part of
the excess of the seven millions over the bars to be allotted in prizes; they
manufactured false lottery tickets; they issued ten, fifteen, and even twenty
tickets with the same number &mdash; a financial operation in the spirit of the
Society of December 10! Here the National Assembly was confronted not with the
fictitious President of the Republic but with Bonaparte in the flesh. Here it
could catch him in the act, in conflict not with the constitution but with the
<em>Code penal</em>. If after Duprat's interpellation it proceeded to the order
of the day, this did not happen merely because Girardin's motion that it should
declare itself "satisfied" reminded the party of Order of its own systematic
corruption. The bourgeois, and above all the bourgeois inflated into a
statesman, supplements his practical meanness by theoretical extravagance. As a
statesman he becomes, like the state power that confronts him, a higher being
that can be fought only in a higher, consecrated fashion. </p>

<p>Bonaparte, who precisely because he was a bohemian, a princely lumpen
proletarian, had the advantage over a rascally bourgeois in that he could
conduct the struggle meanly, now saw, after the Assembly guided him with its
own hand across the slippery ground of the military banquets, the reviews, the
Society of December 10, and finally the Code penal, that the moment had come
when he could pass from an apparent defensive to the offensive. The minor
defeats meanwhile sustained by the Minister of Justice, the Minister of War,
the Minister of the Navy, and the Minister of Finance, through which the
National Assembly signified its snarling displeasure, troubled him little. He
not only prevented the ministers from resigning and thus recognizing the
sovereignty of parliament over the executive power, but could now consummate
what he had begun during the recess of the National Assembly: the severance of
the military power from parliament, <i>the removal of Changarnier</i>. </p>

<p>An Elysée paper published an order of the day alleged to have been addressed
during the month of May to the First Army Division, and therefore proceeding
from Changarnier, in which the officers were urged, in the event of an
insurrection, to give no quarter to the traitors in their own ranks, but to
shoot them immediately, and to refuse troops to the National Assembly if it
should requisition them. On January 3, 1851, the cabinet was interpellated
concerning this order of the day. For the investigation of this matter it
requests a breathing space, first of three months, then of a week, finally of
only twenty-four hours. The Assembly insists on an immediate explanation.
Changarnier rises and declares that there never was such an order of the day.
He adds that he will always hasten to comply with the demands of the National
Assembly and that in case of a clash it can count on him. It receives his
declaration with indescribable applause and passes a vote of confidence in him.
It abdicates, it decrees its own impotence and the omnipotence of the army by
placing itself under the private protection of a general; but the general
deceives himself when he puts at its command against Bonaparte a power that he
holds only as a fief from the same Bonaparte, and when, in his turn, he expects
to be protected by this parliament, his own protègé in need of protection.
Changarnier, however, believes in the mysterious power with which the
bourgeoisie has endowed him since January 29, 1849. He considers himself the
third power, existing side by side with both the other state powers. He shares
the fate of the rest of this epoch's heroes, or rather saints, whose greatness
consists precisely in the biased great opinion of them that their party creates
in its own interests and who shrink to everyday figures as soon as
circumstances call on them to perform miracles. Unbelief is, in general, the
mortal enemy of these reputed heroes who are really saints. Hence their
majestically moral indignation at the dearth of enthusiasm displayed by wits
and scoffers. </p>

<p>That same evening the ministers were summoned to the Elysée. Bonaparte
insists on the dismissal of Changarnier; five ministers refuse to sign; the
Moniteur announces a ministerial crisis, and the press of the party of Order
threatens to form a parliamentary army under Changarnier's command. The party
of Order had constitutional authority to take this step. It merely had to
appoint Changarnier president of the National Assembly and requisition any
number of troops it pleased for its protection. It could do so all the more
safely as Changarnier still actually stood at the head of the army and the
Paris National Guard and was only waiting to be requisitioned together with the
army. The Bonapartist press did not as yet even dare to question the right of
the National Assembly to requisition troops directly, a legal scruple that in
the given circumstances did not look promising. That the army would have obeyed
the order of the National Assembly is probable when one bears in mind that
Bonaparte had to search all Paris for eight days in order, finally, to find two
generals &mdash; Baraguay d'Hilliers and Saint-Jean d'Angely &mdash; who
declared themselves ready to countersign Changarnier's dismissal. That the
party of Order, however, would have found in its own ranks and in parliament
the necessary number of votes for such a resolution is more than doubtful, when
one considers that eight days later two hundred and eighty-six votes detached
themselves from the party and that in December, 1851, at the last hour of
decision, the Montagne still rejected a similar proposal. Nevertheless, the
burgraves might, perhaps, still have succeeded in spurring the mass of their
party to a heroism that consisted in feeling themselves secure behind a forest
of bayonets and accepting the services of an army that had deserted to their
camp. Instead of this, on the evening of January 6, Messrs. the Burgraves
betook themselves to the Elysée to make Bonaparte desist from dismissing
Changarnier by using statesmanlike phrases and urging considerations of state.
Whomever one seeks to persuade, one acknowledges as master of the situation. On
January 12, Bonaparte, assured by this step, appoints a new ministry in which
the leaders of the old ministry, Fould and Baroche, remain. Saint-Jean D'Angely
becomes War Minister, the Moniteur publishes the decree dismissing Changarnier,
and his command is divided between Baraguay d'Hilliers, who receives the First
Army Division, and Perrot, who receives the National Guard. The bulwark of
society has been discharged, and while this does not cause any tiles to fall
from the roofs, quotations on the Bourse are, on the other hand, going up. </p>

<p>By repulsing the army, which places itself in the person of Changarnier at
its disposal, and so surrendering the army irrevocably to the President, the
party of Order declares that the bourgeoisie has forfeited its vocation to
rule. A parliamentary ministry no longer existed. Having now indeed lost its
grip on the army and the National Guard, what forcible means remained to it
with which simultaneously to maintain the usurped authority of parliament over
the people and its constitutional authority against the President? None. Only
the appeal to impotent principles remained to it now, to principles that it had
itself always interpreted merely as general rules, which one prescribes for
others in order to be able to move all the more freely oneself. The dismissal
of Changarnier and the falling of the military power into Bonaparte's hands
closes the first part of the period we are considering, the period of struggle
between the party of Order and the executive power. War between the two powers
has now been openly declared, is openly waged, but only after the party of
Order has lost both arms and soldiers. Without the ministry, without the army,
without the people, without public opinion, after its electoral law of May 31
no longer the representative of the sovereign nation, sans eyes, sans ears,
sans teeth, sans everything, the National Assembly had undergone a gradual
transformation into an <i>ancient French parliament</i><sup class="enote"><a
href="notes.htm#n109">[109]</a></sup> that has to leave action to the
government and content itself with growling remonstrances <em>post festum</em>
<span class="context">[belatedly]</span>. </p>

<p>The party of Order receives the new ministry with a storm of indignation.
General Bedeau recalls to mind the mildness of the Permanent Commission during
the recess, and the excessive consideration it showed by waiving the
publication of its minutes. The Minister of the Interior himself now insists on
the publication of these minutes, which by this time have naturally become as
dull as ditch water, disclose no fresh facts, and have not the slightest effect
on the blasé public. Upon Remusat's proposal the National Assembly retires into
its office and appoints a "Committee for Extraordinary Measures." Paris departs
the less from the rut of its everyday routine because at this moment trade is
prosperous, factories are busy, corn prices low, foodstuffs overflowing, and
the savings banks receiving fresh deposits daily. The "extraordinary measures"
that parliament has announced with so much noise fizzle out on January 18 in a
no-confidence vote against the ministry without General Changarnier ever being
mentioned. The party of Order was forced to frame its motion in this way to
secure the votes of the republicans, since of all the ministry's measures,
Changarnier's dismissal was precisely the only one the republicans approved of,
while the party of Order was in fact not in a position to Censure the other
ministerial acts, which it had itself dictated. </p>

<p>The no-confidence vote of January 18 was passed by four hundred and fifteen
votes to two hundred and eighty-six. Thus, it was carried only by a coalition
of the extreme Legitimists and Orleanists with the pure republicans and the
Montagne. Thus it proved that the party of Order had lost in conflicts with
Bonaparte not only the ministry, not only the army, but also its independent
parliamentary majority; that a squad of representatives had deserted its camp,
out of fanaticism for conciliation, out of fear of the struggle, out of
lassitude, out of family regard for the state salaries so near and dear to
them, out of speculation about ministerial posts becoming vacant (Odilon
Barrot), out of sheer egoism, which makes the ordinary bourgeois always
inclined to sacrifice the general interest of his class for this or that
private motive. From the first, the Bonapartist representatives adhered to the
party of Order only in the struggle against revolution. The leader of the
Catholic party, Montalembert, had already at that time thrown his influence
into the Bonapartist scale, since he despaired of the parliamentary party's
prospects of life. Lastly, the leaders of this party, Thiers and Berryer, the
Orleanist and the Legitimist, were compelled openly to proclaim themselves
republicans, to confess that their hearts were royalist but their heads
republican, that the parliamentary republic was the sole possible form for the
rule of the bourgeoisie as a whole. Thus they were compelled, before the eyes
of the bourgeois class itself, to stigmatize the restoration plans, which they
continued indefatigably to pursue behind parliament's back, as an intrigue as
dangerous as it was brainless. </p>

<p>The no-confidence vote of January 18 hit the ministers and not the
President. But it was not the ministry, it was the President who had dismissed
Changarnier. Should the party of Order impeach Bonaparte himself? Because of
his restoration desires? The latter merely supplemented their own. Because of
his conspiracy in connection with the military reviews and the Society of
December 10? They had buried these themes long since under routine orders of
the day. Because of the dismissal of the hero of January 29 and June 13, the
man who in May, 1850, threatened to set fire to all four corners of Paris in
the event of a rising? Their allies of the Montagne and Cavaignac did not even
allow them to raise the fallen bulwark of society by means of an official
attestation of sympathy. They themselves could not deny the President the
constitutional authority to dismiss a general. They only raged because he made
an unparliamentary use of his constitutional right. Had they not continually
made an unconstitutional use of their parliamentary prerogative, particularly
in regard to the abolition of universal suffrage? They were therefore reduced
to moving within strictly parliamentary limits. And it took that peculiar
malady which since 1848 has raged all over the Continent, <em>parliamentary
cretinism</em>, which holds those infected by it fast in an imaginary world and
robs them of all sense, all memory, all understanding of the rude external
world &mdash; it took this parliamentary cretinism for those who had destroyed
all the conditions of parliamentary power with their own hands, and were bound
to destroy them in their struggle with the other classes, still to regard their
parliamentary victories as victories and to believe they hit the President by
striking at his ministers. They merely gave him the opportunity to humiliate
the National Assembly afresh in the eyes of the nation. On January 20 the
Moniteur announced that the resignation of the entire ministry had been
accepted. On the pretext that no parliamentary party any longer had a majority
&mdash; as the vote of January 18, this fruit of the coalition between Montagne
and royalists, proved &mdash; and pending the formation of a new ministry, of
which not one member was an Assembly representative, all being absolutely
unknown and insignificant individuals; a ministry of mere clerks and copyists.
The party of Order could now work to exhaustion playing with these marionettes;
the executive power no longer thought it worth while to be seriously
represented in the National Assembly. The more his ministers were pure dummies,
the more obviously Bonaparte concentrated the whole executive power in his own
person and the more scope he had to exploit it for his own ends. </p>

<p>In coalition with the Montagne, the party of Order revenged itself by
rejecting the grant to the President of 1,800,000 francs which the chief of the
Society of December 10 had compelled his ministerial clerks to propose. This
time a majority of only a hundred and two votes decided the matter; thus
twenty-seven fresh votes had fallen away since January 18; the dissolution of
the party of Order was progressing. At the same time, so there might not for a
moment be any mistake about the meaning of its coalition with the Montagne, it
scorned even to consider a proposal signed by a hundred and eighty-nine members
of the Montagne calling for a general amnesty of political offenders. It
sufficed for the Minister of the Interior, a certain Vaisse, to declare that
the tranquillity was only apparent, that in secret great agitation prevailed,
that in secret ubiquitous societies were being organized, the democratic papers
were preparing to come out again, the reports from the departments were
unfavorable, the Geneva refugees were directing a conspiracy spreading by way
of Lyon all over the South of France, France was on the verge of an industrial
and commercial crisis, the manufacturers of Roubaix had reduced working hours,
the prisoners of Belle Isle<sup class="enote"><a
href="notes.htm#n110">[110]</a></sup> were in revolt &mdash; it sufficed for
even a mere Vaisse to conjure up the red specter and the party of Order
rejected without discussion a motion that would certainly have won the National
Assembly immense popularity and thrown Bonaparte back into its arms. Instead of
letting itself be intimidated by the executive power with the prospect of fresh
disturbances, it ought rather to have allowed the class struggle a little elbow
room, so as to keep the executive power dependent on it. But it did not feel
equal to the task of playing with fire. </p>

<p>Meanwhile the so-called transition ministry continued to vegetate until the
middle of April. Bonaparte wearied and befooled the National Assembly with
continual new ministerial combinations. Now he seemed to want to form a
republican ministry with Lamartine and Billault, now a parliamentary one with
the inevitable Odilon Barrot, whose name is never missing when a dupe is
necessary, then a Legitimist ministry with Vatimesnil and Benoit d'Azy, and
then again an Orleanist one with Maleville. While he thus kept the different
factions of the party of Order in tension against one another, and alarmed them
as a whole by the prospect of a republican ministry and the consequent
inevitable restoration of universal suffrage, he at the same time engendered in
the bourgeoisie the conviction that his honest efforts to form a parliamentary
ministry were being frustrated by the irreconcilability of the royalist
factions. The bourgeoisie, however, cried out all the louder for a "strong
government"; it found it all the more unpardonable to leave France "without
administration," the more a general commercial crisis seemed now to be
approaching, and won recruits for socialism in the towns just as the ruinously
low price of corn did in the countryside. Trade daily became slacker, the
number of unemployed increased perceptibly; ten thousand workers, at least,
were breadless in Paris, innumerable factories stood idle in Rouen, Mulhouse,
Lyon, Roubaix, Tourcoing, St. Ettienne, Elbeuf, etc. Under these circumstances
Bonaparte could venture, on April 11, to restore the ministry of January 18:
Messrs. Rouher, Fould, Baroche, etc., reinforced by M. Leon Faucher, whom the
Constituent Assembly during its last days had, with the exception of five votes
cast by ministers, unanimously stigmatized by a vote of no confidence for
sending out false telegrams. The National Assembly had therefore gained a
victory over the ministry on January 18, had struggled with Bonaparte for three
months, only to have Fould and Baroche on April 11 admit the puritan Faucher as
a third party into their ministerial alliance. </p>

<p>In November, 1849, Bonaparte had contented himself with an unparliamentary
ministry, in January, 1851, with an extra-parliamentary one, and on April 11 he
felt strong enough to form an anti-parliamentary ministry, which harmoniously
combined in itself the no-confidence votes of both Assemblies, the Constituent
and the Legislative, the republican and the royalist. This gradation of
ministries was the thermometer with which parliament could measure the decrease
of its own vital heat. By the end of April the latter had fallen so low that
Persigny, in a personal interview, could urge Changarnier to go over to the
camp of the President. Bonaparte, he assured him, regarded the influence of the
National Assembly as completely destroyed, and the proclamation was already
prepared that was to be published after the coup d'etat, which was kept
steadily in view but was by chance again postponed. Changarnier informed the
leaders of the party of Order of the obituary notice, but who believes that
bedbug bites are fatal? And parliament, stricken, disintegrated, and
death-tainted as it was, could not prevail upon itself to see in its duel with
the grotesque chief of the Society of December 10 anything but a duel with a
bedbug. But Bonaparte answered the party of Order as Agesilaus did King Agis:
&ldquo;<i>I seem to thee an ant, but one day I shall be a lion</i>.&rdquo; <sup
