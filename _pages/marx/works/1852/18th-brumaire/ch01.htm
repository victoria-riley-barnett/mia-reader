<h1>I</h1>

<p class="fst">Hegel remarks somewhere<sup class="enote"><a
href="../../../../../glossary/terms/h/i.htm#history-repeats">[*]</a></sup> that
all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He
forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce. Caussidière
for Danton, Louis Blanc for Robespierre, the Montagne of 1848 to 1851<sup
class="enote"><a href="notes.htm#n66">[66]</a></sup> for the Montagne of 1793
to 1795, the nephew for the uncle. And the same caricature occurs in the
circumstances of the second edition of the Eighteenth Brumaire.</p>

<p>Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do
not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing
already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead
generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living. And just as
they seem to be occupied with revolutionizing themselves and things, creating
something that did not exist before, precisely in such epochs of revolutionary
crisis they anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service,
borrowing from them names, battle slogans, and costumes in order to present
this new scene in world history in time-honored disguise and borrowed language.
Thus Luther put on the mask of the Apostle Paul, the Revolution of 1789-1814
draped itself alternately in the guise of the Roman Republic and the Roman
Empire, and the Revolution of 1848 knew nothing better to do than to parody,
now 1789, now the revolutionary tradition of 1793-95. In like manner, the
beginner who has learned a new language always translates it back into his
mother tongue, but he assimilates the spirit of the new language and expresses
himself freely in it only when he moves in it without recalling the old and
when he forgets his native tongue.</p>

<p>When we think about this conjuring up of the dead of world history, a
salient difference reveals itself. Camille Desmoulins, Danton, Robespierre, St.
Just, Napoleon, the heroes as well as the parties and the masses of the old
French Revolution, performed the task of their time &ndash; that of unchaining
and establishing modern bourgeois society &ndash; in Roman costumes and with
Roman phrases. The first one destroyed the feudal foundation and cut off the
feudal heads that had grown on it. The other created inside France the only
conditions under which free competition could be developed, parceled-out land
properly used, and the unfettered productive power of the nation employed; and
beyond the French borders it swept away feudal institutions everywhere, to
provide, as far as necessary, bourgeois society in France with an appropriate
up-to-date environment on the European continent. Once the new social formation
was established, the antediluvian colossi disappeared and with them also the
resurrected Romanism &ndash; the Brutuses, the Gracchi, the publicolas, the
tribunes, the senators, and Caesar himself. Bourgeois society in its sober
reality bred its own true interpreters and spokesmen in the Says, Cousins,
Royer-Collards, Benjamin Constants, and Guizots; its real military leaders sat
behind the office desk and the hog-headed Louis XVIII was its political chief.
Entirely absorbed in the production of wealth and in peaceful competitive
struggle, it no longer remembered that the ghosts of the Roman period had
watched over its cradle.</p>

<p><a name="cromwell"></a> But unheroic though bourgeois society is, it
nevertheless needed heroism, sacrifice, terror, civil war, and national wars to
bring it into being. And in the austere classical traditions of the Roman
Republic the bourgeois gladiators found the ideals and the art forms, the
self-deceptions, that they needed to conceal from themselves the
bourgeois-limited content of their struggles and to keep their passion on the
high plane of great historic tragedy. Similarly, at another stage of
development a century earlier, Cromwell and the English people had borrowed
from the Old Testament the speech, emotions, and illusions for their bourgeois
revolution. When the real goal had been achieved and the bourgeois
transformation of English society had been accomplished, Locke supplanted
Habakkuk. </p>

<p>Thus the awakening of the dead in those revolutions served the purpose of
glorifying the new struggles, not of parodying the old; of magnifying the given
task in the imagination, not recoiling from its solution in reality; of finding
once more the spirit of revolution, not making its ghost walk again. </p>
<a name="1.1"></a> 

<p>From 1848 to 1851, only the ghost of the old revolution circulated - from
Marrast, the <em>républicain en gants jaunes</em> <span
class="context">[Republican in yellow gloves]</span>, who disguised himself as
old Bailly, down to the adventurer who hides his trivial and repulsive features
behind the iron death mask of Napoleon. A whole nation, which thought it had
acquired an accelerated power of motion by means of a revolution, suddenly
finds itself set back into a defunct epoch, and to remove any doubt about the
relapse, the old dates arise again &ndash; the old chronology, the old names,
the old edicts, which had long since become a subject of antiquarian
scholarship, and the old minions of the law who had seemed long dead. The
nation feels like the mad Englishman in Bedlam <sup class="enote"><a
href="#1">[1]</a></sup> who thinks he is living in the time of the old Pharaohs
and daily bewails the hard labor he must perform in the Ethiopian gold mines,
immured in this subterranean prison, a pale lamp fastened to his head, the
overseer of the slaves behind him with a long whip, and at the exits a confused
welter of barbarian war slaves who understand neither the forced laborers nor
each other, since they speak no common language. &ldquo;And all this,&rdquo;
sighs the mad Englishman, &ldquo;is expected of me, a freeborn Briton, in order
to make gold for the Pharaohs.&rdquo; &ldquo;In order to pay the debts of the
Bonaparte family,&rdquo; sighs the French nation. The Englishman, so long as he
was not in his right mind, could not get rid of his <i>idée fixé</i> of mining
gold. The French, so long as they were engaged in revolution, could not get rid
of the memory of Napoleon, as the election of December 10 <span
class="context">[1848, when Louis Bonaparte was elected President of the French
Republic by plebiscite.]</span> was proved. They longed to return from the
perils of revolution to the fleshpots of Egypt <sup class="enote"><a
href="#2">[2]</a></sup>, and December 2, 1851 <span class="context">[The date
of the coup d&rsquo;état by Louis Bonaparte]</span>, was the answer. Now they
have not only a caricature of the old Napoleon, but the old Napoleon himself,
caricatured as he would have to be in the middle of the nineteenth century. </p>

<p>The social revolution of the nineteenth century cannot take its poetry from
the past but only from the future. It cannot begin with itself before it has
stripped away all superstition about the past. The former revolutions required
recollections of past world history in order to smother their own content. The
revolution of the nineteenth century must let the dead bury their dead in order
to arrive at its own content. There the phrase went beyond the content &ndash;
here the content goes beyond the phrase. </p>

<p>The February Revolution was a surprise attack, a seizing of the old society
unaware, and the people proclaimed this unexpected stroke a deed of world
importance, ushering in a new epoch. On December 2 the February Revolution is
conjured away as a cardsharp&rsquo;s trick, and what seems overthrown is no
longer the monarchy but the liberal concessions that had been wrung from it
through centuries of struggle. Instead of society having conquered a new
content for itself, it seems that the state has only returned to its oldest
form, to a shamelessly simple rule by the sword and the monk&rsquo;s cowl. This
is the answer to the <i>coup de main</i> <span class="context">[unexpected
stroke]</span> of February, 1848, given by the <i>coup de tête</i> <span
class="context">[rash act]</span> of December, 1851. Easy come, easy go.
Meantime, the interval did not pass unused. During 1848-51 French society, by
an abbreviated revolutionary method, caught up with the studies and experiences
which in a regular, so to speak, textbook course of development would have
preceded the February Revolution, if the latter were to be more than a mere
ruffling of the surface. Society seems now to have retreated to behind its
starting point; in truth, it has first to create for itself the revolutionary
point of departure &ndash; the situation, the relations, the conditions under
which alone modern revolution becomes serious. </p>
<a name="3.0"></a> 

<p>Bourgeois revolutions, like those of the eighteenth century, storm more
swiftly from success to success, their dramatic effects outdo each other, men
and things seem set in sparkling diamonds, ecstasy is the order of the day
&ndash; but they are short-lived, soon they have reached their zenith, and a
long Katzenjammer <span class="context">[cat&rsquo;s winge]</span> takes hold
of society before it learns to assimilate the results of its storm-and-stress
period soberly. On the other hand, proletarian revolutions, like those of the
nineteenth century, constantly criticize themselves, constantly interrupt
themselves in their own course, return to the apparently accomplished, in order
to begin anew; they deride with cruel thoroughness the half-measures,
weaknesses, and paltriness of their first attempts, seem to throw down their
opponents only so the latter may draw new strength from the earth and rise
before them again more gigantic than ever, recoil constantly from the
indefinite colossalness of their own goals &ndash; until a situation is created
which makes all turning back impossible, and the conditions themselves call
out: <a name="3.1"></a> </p>

<p class="indentb"><i>Hic Rhodus, hic salta!</i><br>
<span class="context">[Here is the rose, here dance!]</span> <sup
class="enote"><a href="../../../../../glossary/terms/h/i.htm#hic-rhodus">[NOTE]</a></sup> </p>
<a name="4b"></a> 

<p>For the rest, every fair observer, even if he had not followed the course of
French developments step by step, must have had a presentiment of the imminence
of an unheard-of disgrace for the revolution. It was enough to hear the
complacent yelps of victory with which the democrats congratulated each other
on the expectedly gracious consequences of the second Sunday in May, 1852.
<span class="context">[day of elections &ndash; Louis Bonaparte&rsquo;s term
was expired]</span> In their minds that second Sunday of May had become a
certain idea, a dogma, like the day of Christ&rsquo;s reappearance and the
beginning of the millennium in the minds of the Chiliasts <sup class="enote"><a
href="#4">[4]</a></sup>. As always, weakness had taken refuge in a belief in
miracles, believed the enemy to be overcome when he was only conjured away in
imagination, and lost all understanding of the present in an inactive
glorification of the future that was in store for it and the deeds it had in
mind but did not want to carry out yet. Those heroes who seek to disprove their
demonstrated incapacity &ndash; by offering each other their sympathy and
getting together in a crowd &ndash; had tied up their bundles, collected their
laurel wreaths in advance, and occupied themselves with discounting on the
exchange market the republics <i>in partibus</i> <span class="context">[i.e.,
in name only]</span> for which they had already providently organized the
government personnel with all the calm of their unassuming disposition.
December 2 struck them like a thunderbolt from a clear sky, and those who in
periods of petty depression gladly let their inner fears be drowned by the
loudest renters will perhaps have convinced themselves that the times are past
when the cackle of geese could save the Capitol. <sup class="enote"><a
href="#5">[5]</a></sup> </p>

<p>The constitution, the National Assembly, the dynastic parties, the blue and
red republicans, the heroes of Africa, the thunder from the platform, the sheet
lightning of the daily press, the entire literature, the political names and
the intellectual reputations, the civil law and the penal code, <i>liberté,
egalité, fraternité</i>, and the second Sunday in May, 1852 &ndash; all have
vanished like a phantasmagoria before the spell of a man whom even his enemies
do not make out to be a sorcerer. Universal suffrage seems to have survived
only for the moment, so that with its own hand it may make its last will and
testament before the eyes of all the world and declare in the name of the
people itself: &ldquo;All that exists deserves to perish.&rdquo; <span
class="context">[From Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i>, Part One.]</span></p>

<p>It is not enough to say, as the French do, that their nation was taken
unawares. Nations and women are not forgiven the unguarded hour in which the
first adventurer who came along could violate them. Such turns of speech do not
solve the riddle but only formulate it differently. It remains to be explained
how a nation of thirty-six millions can be surprised and delivered without
resistance into captivity by three knights of industry. </p>

<p>Let us recapitulate in general outline the phases that the French Revolution
went through from February 24, 1848, to December, 1851. </p>

<p>Three main periods are unmistakable: the February period; the period of the
constitution of the republic or the Constituent National Assembly - May 1848 to
May 28 1849; and the period of the constitutional republic or the Legislative
National Assembly &ndash; May 28 1849 to December 2 1851. </p>

<p class="fst"><em>The first period</em> &ndash; from February 24, the
overthrow of Louis Philippe, to May 4, 1848, the meeting of the Constituent
Assembly &ndash; the February period proper, may be designated as the prologue
of the revolution. Its character was officially expressed in the fact that the
government it improvised itself declared that it was provisional, and like the
government, everything that was mentioned, attempted, or enunciated during this
period proclaimed itself to be only provisional. Nobody and nothing ventured to
lay any claim to the right of existence and of real action. All the elements
that had prepared or determined the revolution &ndash; the dynastic opposition,
the republican bourgeoisie, the democratic-republican petty bourgeoisie, and
the social-democratic workers, provisionally found their place in the February
government. </p>

<p>It could not be otherwise. The February days originally intended an
electoral reform by which the circle of the politically privileged among the
possessing class itself was to be widened and the exclusive domination of the
aristocracy of finance overthrown. When it came to the actual conflict, however
&ndash; when the people mounted the barricades, the National Guard maintained a
passive attitude, the army offered no serious resistance, and the monarchy ran
away &ndash; the republic appeared to be a matter of course. Every party
construed it in its own way. Having secured it arms in hand, the proletariat
impressed its stamp upon it and proclaimed it to be a social republic. There
was thus indicated the general content of the modern revolution, a content
which was in most singular contradiction to everything that, with the material
available, with the degree of education attained by the masses, under the given
circumstances and relations, could be immediately realized in practice. On the
other hand, the claims of all the remaining elements that had collaborated in
the February Revolution were recognized by the lion&rsquo;s share they obtained
in the government. In no period, therefore, do we find a more confused mixture
of high-flown phrases and actual uncertainty and clumsiness, of more
enthusiastic striving for innovation and more deeply rooted domination of the
old routine, of more apparent harmony of the whole of society; and more
profound estrangement of its elements. While the Paris proletariat still
reveled in the vision of the wide prospects that had opened before it and
indulged in seriously meant discussions of social problems, the old powers of
society had grouped themselves, assembled, reflected, and found unexpected
support in the mass of the nation, the peasants and petty bourgeois, who all at
once stormed onto the political stage after the barriers of the July Monarchy
had fallen. </p>

<p><em>The second period</em>, from May 4, 1848, to the end of May, 1849, is
the period of the constitution, the foundation, of the bourgeois republic.
Immediately after the February days not only had the dynastic opposition been
surprised by the republicans and the republicans by the socialists, but all
France by Paris. The National Assembly, which met on May 4, 1848, had emerged
from the national elections and represented the nation. It was a living protest
against the pretensions of the February days and was to reduce the results of
the revolution to the bourgeois scale. In vain the Paris proletariat, which
immediately grasped the character of this National Assembly, attempted on May
15, a few days after it met, to negate its existence forcibly, to dissolve it,
to disintegrate again into its constituent parts the organic form in which the
proletariat was threatened by the reacting spirit of the nation. As is known,
May 15 had no other result but that of removing Blanqui and his comrades
&ndash; that is, the real leaders of the proletarian party &ndash; from the
public stage for the entire duration of the cycle we are considering. </p>

<p>The bourgeois monarchy of Louis Philippe can be followed only by a bourgeois
republic; that is to say, whereas a limited section of the bourgeoisie ruled in
the name of the king, the whole of the bourgeoisie will now rule in the name of
the people. The demands of the Paris proletariat are utopian nonsense, to which
an end must be put. To this declaration of the Constituent National Assembly
the Paris proletariat replied with the June insurrection, the most colossal
event in the history of European civil wars. The bourgeois republic triumphed.
On its side stood the aristocracy of finance, the industrial bourgeoisie, the
middle class, the petty bourgeois, the army, the lumpen proletariat organized
as the Mobile Guard, the intellectual lights, the clergy, and the rural
population. On the side of the Paris proletariat stood none but itself. More
than three thousand insurgents were butchered after the victory, and fifteen
thousand were deported without trial. With this defeat the proletariat passes
into the background on the revolutionary stage. It attempts to press forward
again on every occasion, as soon as the movement appears to make a fresh start,
but with ever decreased expenditure of strength and always slighter results. As
soon as one of the social strata above it gets into revolutionary ferment, the
proletariat enters into an alliance with it and so shares all the defeats that
the different parties suffer, one after another. But these subsequent blows
become the weaker, the greater the surface of society over which they are
distributed. The more important leaders of the proletariat in the Assembly and
in the press successively fall victim to the courts, and ever more equivocal
figures come to head it. In part it throws itself into doctrinaire experiments,
exchange banks and workers&rsquo; associations, hence into a movement in which
it renounces the revolutionizing of the old world by means of the
latter&rsquo;s own great, combined resources, and seeks, rather, to achieve its
salvation behind society&rsquo;s back, in private fashion, within its limited
conditions of existence, and hence necessarily suffers shipwreck. It seems to
be unable either to rediscover revolutionary greatness in itself or to win new
energy from the connections newly entered into, until all classes with which it
contended in June themselves lie prostrate beside it. But at least it succumbs
with the honors of the great, world-historic struggle; not only France, but all
Europe trembles at the June earthquake, while the ensuing defeats of the upper
classes are so cheaply bought that they require barefaced exaggeration by the
victorious party to be able to pass for events at all, and become the more
ignominious the further the defeated party is removed from the proletarian
party. </p>

<p>The defeat of the June insurgents, to be sure, had now prepared, had leveled
the ground on which the bourgeois republic could be founded and built, but it
had shown at the same time that in Europe the questions at issue are other than
that of &ldquo;republic or monarchy.&rdquo; It had revealed that here
&ldquo;bourgeois republic&rdquo; signifies the unlimited despotism of one class
over other classes. It had proved that in countries with an old civilization,
with a developed formation of classes, with modern conditions of production,
and with an intellectual consciousness in which all traditional ideas have been
dissolved by the work of centuries, the republic signifies in general only the
political form of revolution of bourgeois society and not its conservative form
of life &ndash; as, for example, in the United States of North America, where,
though classes already exist, they have not yet become fixed, but continually
change and interchange their elements in constant flux, where the modern means
of production, instead of coinciding with a stagnant surplus population, rather
compensate for the relative deficiency of heads and hands, and where, finally,
the feverish, youthful movement of material production, which has to make a new
world of its own, has neither time nor opportunity left for abolishing the old
world of ghosts. </p>

<p>During the June days all classes and parties had united in the party of
Order against the proletarian class as the party of anarchy, of socialism, of
communism. They had &ldquo;saved&rdquo; society from &ldquo;the enemies of
society.&rdquo; They had given out the watchwords of the old society,
&ldquo;property, family, religion, order,&rdquo; to their army as passwords and
had proclaimed to the counterrevolutionary crusaders: &ldquo;In this sign thou
shalt conquer!&rdquo; From that moment, as soon as one of the numerous parties
which gathered under this sign against the June insurgents seeks to hold the
revolutionary battlefield in its own class interest, it goes down before the
cry: &ldquo;property, family, religion, order.&rdquo; Society is saved just as
often as the circle of its rulers contracts, as a more exclusive interest is
maintained against a wider one. Every demand of the simplest bourgeois
financial reform, of the most ordinary liberalism, of the most formal
republicanism, of the most shallow democracy, is simultaneously castigated as
an &ldquo;attempt on society&rdquo; and stigmatized as &ldquo;socialism.&rdquo;
And finally the high priests of &ldquo;religion and order&rdquo; themselves are
driven with kicks from their Pythian tripods, hauled out of their beds in the
darkness of night, put in prison vans, thrown into dungeons or sent into exile;
their temple is razed to the ground, their mouths are sealed, their pens
broken, their law torn to pieces in the name of religion, of property, of the
family, of order. Bourgeois fanatics for order are shot down on their balconies
by mobs of drunken soldiers, their domestic sanctuaries profaned, their houses
bombarded for amusement &ndash; in the name of property, of the family, of
religion, and of order. Finally, the scum of bourgeois society forms the holy
phalanx of order and the hero Crapulinski <span class="context">[a character
from Heine&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;The Two Knights,&rdquo; a dissolute
aristocrat.]</span> installs himself in the Tuileries as the &ldquo;savior of
society.&rdquo;</p>
