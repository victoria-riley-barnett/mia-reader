<p class="title">The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte. 1852</P>
<h1>IV</h1>
<P class="fst">
In the middle of October, 1849, the National Assembly met once more. On
November 1 Bonaparte surprised it with a message in which he announced
the dismissal of the Barrot-Falloux Ministry and the formation of a new
ministry. No one has ever sacked lackeys with less ceremony than
Bonaparte his ministers. The kicks that were intended for the National
Assembly were given in the meantime to Barrot &amp; Co.
</P>

<P>
The Barrot Ministry, as we have seen, had been composed of Legitimists
and Orleanists; it was a ministry of the party of Order. Bonaparte had
needed it to dissolve the republican Constituent Assembly, to bring
about the expedition against Rome, and to break the Democratic party.
Behind this ministry he had seemingly effaced himself, surrendered
governmental power into the hands of the party of Order, and donned the
modest character mask that the responsible editor of a newspaper wore
under Louis Philippe, the mask of the <i>homme de paille</i> 
<span class="context">[straw man]</span>. He
now threw off a mask which was no longer the light veil behind which he
could hide his physiognomy, but an iron mask which prevented him from
displaying a physiognomy of his own. He had appointed the Barrot
Ministry in order to blast the republican National Assembly in the name
of the party of Order; he dismissed it in order to declare his own name
independent of the National Assembly of the party of Order.
</P>

<P>
Plausible pretexts for this dismissal were not lacking. The Barrot
Ministry neglected even the decencies that would have let the President
of the Republic appear as a power side by side with the National
Assembly. During the recess of the National Assembly Bonaparte
published a letter to Edgar Ney in which he seemed to disapprove of the
illiberal attitude of the Pope, just as in opposition to the
Constituent Assembly he had published a letter in which he commended
Oudinot for the attack on the Roman republic. When the National
Assembly now voted the budget for the Roman expedition, Victor Hugo,
out of alleged liberalism, brought up this letter for discussion. The
party of Order with scornfully incredulous outcries stifled the idea
that Bonaparte's ideas could have any political importance. Not one of
the ministers took up the gauntlet for him. On another occasion Barrot,
with his well-known hollow rhetoric, let fall from the platform words
of indignation concerning the "abominable intrigues" that, according to
his assertion, went on in the immediate entourage of the President.
Finally, while the ministry obtained from the National Assembly a
widow's pension for the Duchess of Orleans it rejected any proposal to
increase the Civil List of the President. And in Bonaparte the imperial
pretender was so intimately bound up with the adventurer down on his
luck that the one great idea, that he was called to restore the empire,
was always supplemented by the other, that it was the mission of the
French people to pay his debts.
</P>

<P>
The Barrot-Falloux Ministry was the first and last parliamentary
ministry that Bonaparte brought into being. Its dismissal forms,
accordingly, a decisive turning point. With it the party of Order lost,
never to reconquer it, an indispensable position for the maintenance of
the parliamentary regime, the lever of executive power. It is
immediately obvious that in a country like France, where the executive
power commands an army of officials numbering more than half a million
individuals and therefore constantly maintains an immense mass of
interests and livelihoods in the most absolute dependence; where the
state enmeshes, controls, regulates, superintends, and tutors civil
society from its most comprehensive manifestations of life down to its
most insignificant stirrings, from its most general modes of being to
the private existence of individuals; where through the most
extraordinary centralization this parasitic body acquires a ubiquity,
an omniscience, a capacity for accelerated mobility, and an elasticity
which finds a counterpart only in the helpless dependence, the loose
shapelessness of the actual body politic &#8212; it is obvious that in such
a country the National Assembly forfeits all real influence when it
loses command of the ministerial posts, if it does not at the same time
simplify the administration of the state, reduce the army of officials
as far as possible, and, finally, let civil society and public opinion
create organs of their own, independent of the governmental power. But
it is precisely with the maintenance of that extensive state machine in
its numerous ramifications that the material interests of the French
bourgeoisie are interwoven in the closest fashion. Here it finds posts
for its surplus population and makes up in the form of state salaries
for what it cannot pocket in the form of profit, interest, rents, and
honorariums. On the other hand, its political interests compelled it to
increase daily the repressive measures and therefore the resources and
the personnel of the state power, while at the same time it had to wage
an uninterrupted war against public opinion and mistrustfully mutilate,
cripple, the independent organs of the social movement, where it did
not succeed in amputating them entirely. Thus the French bourgeoisie
was compelled by its class position to annihilate, on the one hand, the
vital conditions of all parliamentary power, and therefore, likewise,
of its own, and to render irresistible, on the other hand, the
executive power hostile to it.
</P>

<P>
The new ministry was called the Hautpoul Ministry. Not in the sense
that General Hautpoul had received the rank of Prime Minister. Rather,
simultaneously with Barrot's dismissal, Bonaparte abolished this
dignity, which, true enough, condemned the President of the Republic to
the status of the legal nonentity of a constitutional monarch, but of a
constitutional monarch without throne or crown, without scepter or
sword, without freedom from responsibility, without imprescriptible
possession of the highest state dignity, and worst of all, without a
Civil List. The Hautpoul Ministry contained only one man of
parliamentary standing, the moneylender Fould, one of the most
notorious of the high financiers. To his lot fell the Ministry of
Finance. Look up the quotations on the Paris Bourse and you will find
that from November 1, 1849, onward the French <em>fonds</em> 
<span class="context">[government securities]</span>
rise and fall with the rise and fall of Bonapartist stocks.
While Bonaparte had thus found his ally in the Bourse, he at the same
time took possession of the police by appointing Carlier police prefect
of Paris.
</P>

<P>
Only in the course of development, however, could the consequences of
the change of ministers come to light. To begin with, Bonaparte had
taken a step forward only to be driven backward all the more
conspicuously. His brusque message was followed by the most servile
declaration of allegiance to the National Assembly. As often as the
ministers dared to make a diffident attempt to introduce his personal
fads as legislative proposals, they themselves seemed to carry out,
against their will and compelled by their position, comical commissions
whose fruitlessness they were persuaded of in advance. As often as
Bonaparte blurted out his intentions behind the ministers' backs and
played with his &#8220;<em>idees napoleoniennes</em>,&#8221;
<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.htm#n100">[100]</a></sup> his own ministers disavowed him
from the tribune of the National Assembly. His usurpatory longings
seemed to make themselves heard only in order that the malicious
laughter of his opponents might not be muted. He behaved like an
unrecognized genius, whom all the world takes for a simpleton. Never
did he enjoy the contempt of all classes in fuller measure than during
this period. Never did the bourgeoisie rule more absolutely, never did
it display more ostentatiously the insignia of domination.
</P>

<P>
I need not write here the history of its legislative activity, which is
summarized during this period in two laws: in the law reestablishing
the wine tax and the education law abolishing unbelief.<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.htm#n101">[101]</a></sup> If wine
drinking was made harder for the French, they were presented all the
more plentifully with the water of true life. If in the law on the
wine tax the bourgeoisie declared the old, hateful French tax system to
be inviolable, it sought through the education law to insure among the
masses the old state of mind that put up with the tax system. One is
astonished to see the Orleanists, the liberal bourgeois, these old
apostles of Voltaireanism and eclectic philosophy, entrust to their
hereditary enemies, the Jesuits, the superintendence of the French
mind. However Orleanists and Legitimists could part company in regard
to the pretenders to the throne, they understood that securing their
united rule necessitated the uniting of the means of repression of two
epochs, that the means of subjugation of the July Monarchy had to be
supplemented and strengthened by the means of subjugation of the
Restoration.
</P>

<P>
The peasants, disappointed in all their hopes, crushed more than ever
by the low level of grain prices on the one hand, and by the growing
burden of taxes and mortgage debts on the other, began to bestir
themselves in the departments. They were answered by a drive against
the schoolmasters, who were made subject to the clergy, by a drive
against the mayors, made subject to the prefects, and by a system of
espionage to which all were made subject. In Paris and the large towns
reaction itself has the physiognomy of its epoch and challenges more
than it strikes down. In the countryside it becomes dull, coarse,
petty, tiresome, and vexatious, in a word, the gendarme. One
comprehends how three years of the regime of the gendarme, consecrated
by the regime of the priest, were bound to demoralize immature masses.
</P>

<P>
Whatever amount of passion and declamation might be employed by the
party of Order against the minority from the tribune of the National
Assembly, its speech remained as monosyllabic as that of the
Christians, whose words were to be: Yea, yea; nay, nay! As monosyllabic
on the platform as in the press. Flat as a riddle whose answer is known
in advance. Whether it was a question of the right of petition or the
tax on wine, freedom of the press or free trade, the clubs or the
municipal charter, protection of personal liberty or regulation of the
state budget, the watchword constantly recurs, the theme remains always
the same, the verdict is ever ready and invariably reads: "Socialism!"
Even bourgeois liberalism is declared socialistic, bourgeois
enlightenment socialistic, bourgeois financial reform socialistic. It
was socialistic to build a railway where a canal already existed, and
it was socialistic to defend oneself with a cane when one was attacked
with a rapier.
</P>

<P>
This was not merely a figure of speech, fashion, or party tactics. The
bourgeoisie had a true insight into the fact that all the weapons it
had forged against feudalism turned their points against itself, that
all the means of education it had produced rebelled against its own
civilization, that all the gods it had created had fallen away from it.
It understood that all the so-called bourgeois liberties and organs of
progress attacked and menaced its class rule at its social foundation
and its political summit simultaneously, and had therefore become
"socialistic." In this menace and this attack it rightly discerned the
secret of socialism, whose import and tendency it judges more correctly
than so-called socialism knows how to judge itself; the latter can,
accordingly, not comprehend why the bourgeoisie callously hardens its
heart against it, whether it sentimentally bewails the sufferings of
mankind, or in Christian spirit prophesies the millennium and universal
brotherly love, or in humanistic style twaddles about mind, education,
and freedom, or in doctrinaire fashion invents a system for the
conciliation and welfare of all classes. What the bourgeoisie did not
grasp, however, was the logical conclusion that its own parliamentary
regime, its political rule in general, was now also bound to meet with
the general verdict of condemnation as being socialistic. As long as
the rule of the bourgeois class had not been completely organized, as
long as it had not acquired its pure political expression, the
antagonism of the other classes likewise could not appear in its pure
form, and where it did appear could not take the dangerous turn that
transforms every struggle against the state power into a struggle
against capital. If in every stirring of life in society it saw
"tranquillity" imperiled, how could it want to maintain at the head of
society a regime of unrest, its own regime, the parliamentary regime,
this regime that, according to the expression of one of its spokesmen,
lives in struggle and by struggle? The parliamentary regime lives by
discussion, how shall it forbid discussion? Every interest, every
social institution, is here transformed into general ideas, debated as
ideas; how shall any interest, any institution, sustain itself above
thought and impose itself as an article of faith? The struggle of the
orators on the platform evokes the struggle of the scribblers of the
press; the debating club in parliament is necessarily supplemented by
debating clubs in the salons and the bistros; the representatives, who
constantly appeal to public opinion, give public opinion the right to
speak its real mind in petitions. The parliamentary regime leaves
everything to the decision of majorities; how shall the great
majorities outside parliament not want to decide? When you play the
fiddle at the top of the state, what else is to be expected but that
those down below dance?
</P>

<P>
Thus by now stigmatizing as "socialistic" what it had previously
extolled as "liberal," the bourgeoisie confesses that its own interests
dictate that it should be delivered from the danger of its own rule;
that to restore tranquillity in the country its bourgeois parliament
must, first of all, be given its quietus; that to preserve its social
power intact its political power must be broken; that the individual
bourgeois can continue to exploit the other classes and to enjoy
undisturbed property, family, religion, and order only on condition
that their class be condemned along with the other classes to like
political nullity; that in order to save its purse it must forfeit the
crown, and the sword that is to safeguard it must at the same time be
hung over its own head as a sword of Damocles.
</P>

<P>
In the domain of the interests of the general citizenry, the National
Assembly showed itself so unproductive that, for example, the
discussions on the Paris-Avignon railway, which began in the winter of
1850, were still not ripe for conclusion on December 2, 1851. Where it
did not repress or pursue a reactionary course it was stricken with
incurable barrenness.
</P>

<P>
While Bonaparte's ministry partly took the initiative in framing laws
in the spirit of the party of Order, and partly even outdid that
party's harshness in their execution and administration, he, on the
other hand, sought by childishly silly proposals to win popularity, to
bring out his opposition to the National Assembly, and to hint at a
secret reserve that was only temporarily prevented by conditions from
making its hidden treasures available to the French people. Such was
the proposal to decree an increase in pay of four sous a day to the
noncommissioned officers. Such was the proposal of an honor-system loan
bank for the workers. Money as a gift and money as a loan, it was with
prospects such as these that he hoped to lure the masses. Donations and
loans &#8212; the financial science of the lumpen proletariat, whether of
high degree or low, is restricted to this. Such were the only springs
Bonaparte knew how to set in action. Never has a pretender speculated
more stupidly on the stupidity of the masses.
</P>

<P>
The National Assembly flared up repeatedly over these unmistakable
attempts to gain popularity at its expense, over the growing danger
that this adventurer, whom his debts spurred on and no established
reputation held back, would venture a desperate coup. The discord
between the party of Order and the President had taken on a threatening
character when an unexpected event threw him back repentant into its
arms. We mean the by-elections of March 10, 1850. These elections were
held for the purpose of filling the representatives' seats that after
June 13 had been rendered vacant by imprisonment or exile. Paris
elected only social-democratic candidates. It even concentrated most of
the votes on an insurgent of June, 1848, on De Flotte. Thus did the
Parisian petty bourgeoisie, in alliance with the proletariat, revenge
itself for its defeat on June 13, 1849. It seemed to have disappeared
from the battlefield at the moment of danger only to reappear there on
a more propitious occasion with more numerous fighting forces and with
a bolder battle cry. One circumstance seemed to heighten the peril of
this election victory. The army voted in Paris for the June insurgent
against La Hitte, a minister of Bonaparte's, and in the departments
largely for the Montagnards, who here too, though indeed not so
decisively as in Paris, maintained the ascendancy over their
adversaries.
</P>

<P>
Bonaparte saw himself suddenly confronted with revolution once more. As
on January 29, 1849, as on June 13, 1849, so on March 10, 1850, he
disappeared behind the party of Order. He made obeisance, he
pusillanimously begged pardon, he offered to appoint any ministry it
pleased at the behest of the parliamentary majority, he even implored
the Orleanist and Legitimist party leaders, the Thiers, the Berryers,
the Broglies, the Moles, in brief, the so-called burgraves,<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.htm#n102">[102]</a></sup> to take
the helm of state themselves. The party of Order proved unable to take
advantage of this opportunity that would never return. Instead of
boldly possessing itself of the power offered, it did not even compel
Bonaparte to reinstate the ministry dismissed on November 1; it
contented itself with humiliating him by its forgiveness and adjoining
M. Baroche to the Hautpoul Ministry. As public prosecutor this Baroche
had stormed and raged before the High Court at Bourges, the first time
against the revolutionists of May 15,<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.htm#n103">[103]</a></sup> the second time against the
democrats of June 13, both times because of an attempt on the life of
the National Assembly. None of Bonaparte's ministers subsequently
contributed more to the degradation of the National Assembly, and after
December 2, 1851, we meet him once more as the comfortably installed
and highly paid vice president of the Senate. He had spat in the
revolutionists' soup in order that Bonaparte might eat it up.
</P>

<P>
The social-democratic party, for its part, seemed only to look for
pretexts to put its own victory once again in doubt and to blunt its
point. Vidal, one of the newly elected representatives of Paris, had
been elected simultaneously in Strasbourg. He was induced to decline
the election for Paris and accept it for Strasbourg. And so, instead of
making its victory at the polls conclusive and thereby compelling the
party of Order to contest it in parliament at once, instead of thus
forcing the adversary to fight at the moment of popular enthusiasm and
favorable mood in the army, the democratic party wearied Paris during
the months of March and April with a new election campaign, let the
aroused popular passions wear themselves out in this repeated
provisional election game, let the revolutionary energy satiate itself
with constitutional successes, dissipate itself in petty intrigues,
hollow declamations, and sham movements, let the bourgeoisie rally and
make its preparations, and, lastly, weakened the significance of the
March elections by a sentimental commentary in the April by-election,
the election of Eugene Sue. In a word, it made an April Fool of March
10.
</P>

<P>
The parliamentary majority understood the weakness of its antagonist.
Its seventeen burgraves &#8212; for Bonaparte had left to it the direction
of and responsibility for the attack &#8212; drew up a new electoral law,
the introduction of which was entrusted to M. Faucher, who solicited
this honor for himself. On May 8 he introduced the law by which
universal suffrage was to be abolished, a residence of three years in
the locality of the election to be imposed as a condition on the
electors, and finally, the proof of this residence made dependent in
the case of workers on a certificate from their employers.
</P>

<P>
Just as the democrats had, in revolutionary fashion, raged and agitated
during the constitutional election contest, so now, when it was
requisite to prove the serious nature of that victory arms in hand, did
they in constitutional fashion preach order, <em>calme majestueux</em>, lawful
action, that is to say, blind subjection to the will of the
counterrevolution, which imposed itself as the law. During the debate
the "Mountain" put the party of Order to shame by asserting, against the
latter's revolutionary passion, the dispassionate attitude of the
philistine who keeps within the law, and by felling that party to earth
with the fearful reproach that it was proceeding in a revolutionary
manner. Even the newly elected deputies were at pains to prove by their
decorous and discreet action what a misconception it was to decry them
as anarchists and construe their election as a victory for revolution.
On May 31 the new electoral law went through. The Montagne contented
itself with smuggling a protest into the President's pocket. The
electoral law was followed by a new press law, by which the
revolutionary newspaper press was entirely suppressed.<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.htm#n104">[104]</a></sup> It had deserved
its fate. <i>The National</i> and <i>La Presse</i>, two bourgeois organs, were left
after this deluge as the most advanced outposts of the revolution.
</P>

<P>
We have seen how during March and April the democratic leaders had done
everything to embroil the people of Paris in a sham fight, how after
May 8 they did everything to restrain them from a real fight. In
addition to this, we must not forget that the year 1850 was one of the
most splendid years of industrial and commercial prosperity, and the
Paris proletariat was therefore fully employed. But the election law of
May 31, 1850, excluded it from any participation in political power. It
cut the proletariat off from the very arena of the struggle. It threw
the workers back into the position of pariahs which they had occupied
before the February Revolution. By letting themselves be led by the
democrats in the face of such an event and forgetting the revolutionary
interests of their class for momentary case and comfort, they renounced
the honor of being a conquering power, surrendered to their fate,
proved that the defeat of June, 1848, had put them out of the fight for
years and that the historical process would for the present again have
to go on over their heads. As for the petty-bourgeois democracy, which
on June 13 had cried, "But if once universal suffrage is attacked, then
we'll show them," it now consoled itself with the contention that the
counterrevolutionary blow which had struck it was no blow and the law
of May 31 no law. On the second Sunday in May, 1852, every Frenchman
would appear at the polling place with ballot in one hand and sword in
the other. With this prophecy it rested content. Lastly, the army was
disciplined by its superior officers for the elections of March and
April, 1850, just as it had been disciplined for those of May 28, 1849.
This time, however, it said decidedly: "The revolution shall not dupe
us a third time."
</P>

<P>
The law of May 31, 1850, was the coup d'etat of the bourgeoisie. All
its conquests over the revolution hitherto had only a provisional
character and were endangered as soon as the existing National Assembly
retired from the stage. They depended on the hazards of a new general
election, and the history of elections since 1848 irrefutably proved
that the bourgeoisie's moral sway over the mass of the people was lost
in the same measure as its actual domination developed. On March 10
universal suffrage declared itself directly against the domination of
the bourgeoisie; the bourgeoisie answered by outlawing universal
suffrage. The law of May 31 was therefore one of the necessities of the
class struggle. On the other hand, the constitution required a minimum
of two million votes to make an election of the President of the
Republic valid. If none of the candidates for the presidency received
this minimum, the National Assembly was to choose the President from
among the three candidates to whom the largest number of votes would
fall. At the time when the Constituent Assembly made this law, ten
million electors were registered on the rolls of voters. In its view,
therefore, a fifth of the people entitled to vote was sufficient to
make the presidential election valid. The law of May 31 struck at least
three million votes off the electoral rolls, reduced the number of
people entitled to vote to seven million, and nevertheless retained the
legal minimum of two million for the presidential election. It
therefore raised the legal minimum from a fifth to nearly a third of
the effective votes; that is, it did everything to smuggle the election
of the President out of the hands of the people and into the hands of
the National Assembly. Thus through the electoral law of May 31 the
party of Order seemed to have made its rule doubly secure, by
surrendering the election of the National Assembly and that of the
President of the Republic to the stationary section of society.
