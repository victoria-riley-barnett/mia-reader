Engels\' *The Peasant Question in France and Germany* was part of the
current debate around agrarian issues. Engels wrote it as rebuttal to
various French Socialists (like Vollmar) and the agrarian programme
adopted in Marseilles in 1892 and supplemented in Nantes in 1894
(Frankfurt Congress of German Social-Democrats). In it, Engels discusses
a policy of alliance between the working class and the working
peasantry.
