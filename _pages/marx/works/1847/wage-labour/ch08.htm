Wage Labour and Capital </p>
<hr class="end">

<h3>The Interests of Capital and Wage-Labour are diametrically opposed<br>
Effect of growth of productive Capital on Wages </h3>
<hr class="end">

<p>  </p>

<p>We thus see that, even if we keep ourselves within the relation of capital
and wage-labour, the interests of capitals and the interests of wage-labour are
diametrically opposed to each other. </p>

<p>A rapid growth of capital is synonymous with a rapid growth of profits.
Profits can grow rapidly only when the price of labour &ndash; the relative
wages &ndash; decrease just as rapidly. Relative wages may fall, although real
wages rise simultaneously with nominal wages, with the money value of labour,
provided only that the real wage does not rise in the same proportion as the
profit. If, for instance, in good business years wages rise 5 per cent, while
profits rise 30 per cent, the proportional, the relative wage has not
increased, but decreased. </p>

<p>If, therefore, the income of the worker increased with the rapid growth of
capital, there is at the same time a widening of the social chasm that divides
the worker from the capitalist, and increase in the power of capital over
labour, a greater dependence of labour upon capital. </p>

<p>To say that "the worker has an interest in the rapid growth of capital",
means only this: that the more speedily the worker augments the wealth of the
capitalist, the larger will be the crumbs which fall to him, the greater will
be the number of workers than can be called into existence, the more can the
mass of slaves dependent upon capital be increased. </p>

<p>We have thus seen that even the most favorable situation for the working
class, namely, the most rapid growth of capital, however much it may improve
the material life of the worker, does not abolish the antagonism between his
interests and the interests of the capitalist. Profit and wages remain as
before, in inverse proportion. </p>

<p>If capital grows rapidly, wages may rise, but the profit of capital rises
disproportionately faster. The material position of the worker has improved,
but at the cost of his social position. The social chasm that separates him
from the capitalist has widened. </p>

<p>Finally, to say that "the most favorable condition for wage-labour is the
fastest possible growth of productive capital", is the same as to say: the
quicker the working class multiplies and augments the power inimical to it
&ndash; the wealth of another which lords over that class &ndash; the more
favorable will be the conditions under which it will be permitted to toil anew
at the multiplication of bourgeois wealth, at the enlargement of the power of
capital, content thus to forge for itself the golden chains by which the
bourgeoisie drags it in its train. </p>

<p>Growth of productive capital and rise of wages, are they really so
indissolubly united as the bourgeois economists maintain? We must not believe
their mere words. We dare not believe them even when they claim that the fatter
capital is the more will its slave be pampered. The bourgeoisie is too much
enlightened, it keeps its accounts much too carefully, to share the prejudices
of the feudal lord, who makes an ostentatious display of the magnificence of
his retinue. The conditions of existence of the bourgeoisie compel it to attend
carefully to its bookkeeping. We must therefore examine more closely into the
following question: </p>

<h5>In what manner does the growth of productive capital affect wages?</h5>

<p>If as a whole, the productive capital of bourgeois society grows, there
takes place a more many-sided accumulation of labour. The individual capitals
increase in number and in magnitude. The multiplications of individual capitals
increases the competition among capitalists. The increasing magnitude of
increasing capitals provides the means of leading more powerful armies of
workers with more gigantic instruments of war upon the industrial battlefield.
</p>

<p>The one capitalist can drive the other from the field and carry off his
capital only by selling more cheaply. In order to sell more cheaply without
ruining himself, he must produce more cheaply &ndash; i.e., increase the
productive forces of labour as much as possible. </p>

<p>But the productive forces of labour is increased above all by a greater
division of labour and by a more general introduction and constant improvement
of machinery. The larger the army of workers among whom the labour is
subdivided, the more gigantic the scale upon which machinery is introduced, the
more in proportion does the cost of production decrease, the more fruitful is
the labour. And so there arises among the capitalists a universal rivalry for
the increase of the division of labour and of machinery and for their
exploitation upon the greatest possible scale. </p>

<p>If, now, by a greater division of labour, by the application and improvement
of new machines, by a more advantageous exploitation of the forces of nature on
a larger scale, a capitalist has found the means of producing with the same
amount of labour (whether it be direct or accumulated labour) a larger amount
of products of commodities than his competitors &ndash; if, for instance, he
can produce a whole yard of linen in the same labour-time in which his
competitors weave half-a-yard &ndash; how will this capitalist act? </p>

<p>He could keep on selling half-a-yard of linen at old market price; but this
would not have the effect of driving his opponents from the field and enlarging
his own market. But his need of a market has increased in the same measure in
which his productive power has extended. The more powerful and costly means of
production that he has called into existence enable him, it is true, to sell
his wares more cheaply, but they compel him at the same time to sell more
wares, to get control of a very much greater market for his commodities;
consequently, this capitalist will sell his half-yard of linen more cheaply
than his competitors. </p>

<p>But the capitalist will not sell the whole yard so cheaply as his
competitors sell the half-yard, although the production of the whole yard costs
him no more than does that of the half-yard to the others. Otherwise, he would
make no extra profit, and would get back in exchange only the cost of
production. He might obtain a greater income from having set in motion a larger
capital, but not from having made a greater profit on his capital than the
others. Moreover, he attains the object he is aiming at if he prices his goods
only a small percentage lower than his competitors. He drives them off the
field, he wrests from them at least part of their market, by underselling them.
</p>

<p>And finally, let us remember that the current price always stands either
above or below the cost of production, according as the sale of a commodity
takes place in the favorable or unfavorable period of the industry. According
as the market price of the yard of linen stands above or below its former cost
of production, will the percentage vary at which the capitalist who has made
use of the new and more faithful means of production sell above his real cost
of production. </p>

<p>But the privilege of our capitalist is not of long duration. Other competing
capitalists introduce the same machines, the same division of labour, and
introduce them upon the same or even upon a greater scale. And finally this
introduction becomes so universal that the price of the linen is lowered not
only below its old, but even below its new cost of production. </p>

<p>The capitalists therefore find themselves, in their mutual relations, in the
same situation in which they were before the introduction of the new means of
production; and if they are by these means enabled to offer double the product
at the old price, they are now forced to furnish double the product for less
than the old price. Having arrived at the new point, the new cost of
production, the battle for supremacy in the market has to be fought out anew.
Given more division of labour and more machinery, and there results a greater
scale upon which division of labour and machinery are exploited. And
competition again brings the same reaction against this result. </p>
