Wage Labour and Capital </p>

<h3>By what are wages determined? </h3>
<hr class="end">

<p>  </p>

<p>Now, the same general laws which regulate the price of commodities in
general, naturally regulate wages, or the price of labour-power. Wages will now
rise, now fall, according to the relation of supply and demand, according as
competition shapes itself between the buyers of labour-power, the capitalists,
and the sellers of labour-power, the workers. The fluctuations of wages
correspond to the fluctuation in the price of commodities in general. But
within the limits of these fluctuations the price of labour-power will be
determined by the cost of production, by the labour-time necessary for
production of this commodity: labour-power. </p>

<p>What, then, is the cost of production of labour-power? </p>

<p>It is the cost required for the maintenance of the labourer as a labourer,
and for his education and training as a labourer. </p>

<p>Therefore, the shorter the time required for training up to a particular
sort of work, the smaller is the cost of production of the worker, the lower is
the price of his labour-power, his wages. In those branches of industry in
which hardly any period of apprenticeship is necessary and the mere bodily
existence of the worker is sufficient, the cost of his production is limited
almost exclusively to the commodities necessary for keeping him in working
condition. The price of his work will therefore be determined by the price of
the necessary means of subsistence. </p>

<p>Here, however, there enters another consideration. The manufacturer who
calculates his cost of production and, in accordance with it, the price of the
product, takes into account the wear and tear of the instruments of labour. If
a machine costs him, for example, 1,000 shillings, and this machine is used up
in 10 years, he adds 100 shillings annually to the price of the commodities, in
order to be able after 10 years to replace the worn-out machine with a new one.
In the same manner, the cost of production of simple labour-power must include
the cost of propagation, by means of which the race of workers is enabled to
multiply itself, and to replace worn-out workers with new ones. The wear and
tear of the worker, therefore, is calculated in the same manner as the wear and
tear of the machine. </p>

<p>Thus, the cost of production of simple labour-power amounts to the cost of
the existence and propagation of the worker. The price of this cost of
existence and propagation constitutes wages. The wages thus determined are
called the minimum of wages. This minimum wage, like the determination of the
price of commodities in general by cost of production, does not hold good for
the single individual, but only for the race. Individual workers, indeed,
millions of workers, do not receive enough to be able to exist and to propagate
themselves; but the wages of the whole working class adjust themselves, within
the limits of their fluctuations, to this minimum. </p>

<p>Now that we have come to an understanding in regard to the most general laws
which govern wages, as well as the price of every other commodity, we can
examine our subject more particularly. </p>
