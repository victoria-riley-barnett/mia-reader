<h3>Effect of Capitalist Competition on the Capitalist Class<br>
the Middle Class and the Working Class </h3>
<hr class="end">

<p>  </p>

<p>We thus see how the method of production and the means of production are
constantly enlarged, revolutionized, how division of labour necessarily draws
after it greater division of labour, the employment of machinery greater
employment of machinery, work upon a large scale work upon a still greater
scale. This is the law that continually throws capitalist production out of its
old ruts and compels capital to strain ever more the productive forces of
labour for the very reason that it has already strained them &ndash; the law
that grants it no respite, and constantly shouts in its ear: March! march! This
is no other law than that which, within the periodical fluctuations of
commerce, necessarily adjusts the price of a commodity to its cost of
production. </p>

<p>No matter how powerful the means of production which a capitalist may bring
into the field, competition will make their adoption general; and from the
moment that they have been generally adopted, the sole result of the greater
productiveness of his capital will be that he must furnish at the same price,
10, 20, 100 times as much as before. But since he must find a market for,
perhaps, 1,000 times as much, in order to outweigh the lower selling price by
the greater quantity of the sale; since now a more extensive sale is necessary
not only to gain a greater profit, but also in order to replace the cost of
production (the instrument of production itself grows always more costly, as we
have seen), and since this more extensive sale has become a question of life
and death not only for him, but also for his rivals, the old struggle must
begin again, and it is all the more violent the more powerful the means of
production already invented are. The division of labour and the application of
machinery will therefore take a fresh start, and upon an even greater scale.
</p>

<p>Whatever be the power of the means of production which are employed,
competition seeks to rob capital of the golden fruits of this power by reducing
the price of commodities to the cost of production; in the same measure in
which production is cheapened - i.e., in the same measure in which more can be
produced with the same amount of labour &ndash; it compels by a law which is
irresistible a still greater cheapening of production, the sale of ever greater
masses of product for smaller prices. Thus the capitalist will have gained
nothing more by his efforts than the obligation to furnish a greater product in
the same labour-time; in a word, more difficult conditions for the profitable
employment of his capital. While competition, therefore, constantly pursues him
with its law of the cost of production and turns against himself every weapon
that he forges against his rivals, the capitalist continually seeks to get the
best of competition by restlessly introducing further subdivision of labour and
new machines, which, though more expensive, enable him to produce more cheaply,
instead of waiting until the new machines shall have been rendered obsolete by
competition. </p>

<p>If we now conceive this feverish agitation as it operates in the market of
the whole world, we shall be in a position to comprehend how the growth,
accumulation, and concentration of capital bring in their train an ever more
detailed subdivision of labour, an ever greater improvement of old machines,
and a constant application of new machine &ndash; a process which goes on
uninterruptedly, with feverish haste, and upon an ever more gigantic scale. </p>

<p>But what effect do these conditions, which are inseparable from the growth
of productive capital, have upon the determination of wages? </p>

<p>The greater division of labour enables one labourer to accomplish the work
of five, 10, or 20 labourers; it therefore increases competition among the
labourers fivefold, tenfold, or twentyfold. The labourers compete not only by
selling themselves one cheaper than the other, but also by one doing the work
of five, 10, or 20; and they are forced to compete in this manner by the
division of labour, which is introduced and steadily improved by capital. </p>

<p>Furthermore, to the same degree in which the division of labour increases,
is the labour simplified. The special skill of the labourer becomes worthless.
He becomes transformed into a simple monotonous force of production, with
neither physical nor mental elasticity. His work becomes accessible to all;
therefore competitors press upon him from all sides. Moreover, it must be
remembered that the more simple, the more easily learned the work is, so much
the less is its cost to production, the expense of its acquisition, and so much
the lower must the wages sink &ndash; for, like the price of any other
commodity, they are determined by the cost of production. Therefore, in the
same manner in which labour becomes more unsatisfactory, more repulsive, do
competition increase and wages decrease. </p>

<p>The labourer seeks to maintain the total of his wages for a given time by
performing more labour, either by working a great number of hours, or by
accomplishing more in the same number of hours. Thus, urged on by want, he
himself multiplies the disastrous effects of division of labour. The result is:
the more he works, the less wages he receives. And for this simple reason: the
more he works, the more he competes against his fellow workmen, the more he
compels them to compete against him, and to offer themselves on the same
wretched conditions as he does; so that, in the last analysis, he competes
against himself as a member of the working class. </p>

<p>Machinery produces the same effects, but upon a much larger scale. It
supplants skilled labourers by unskilled, men by women, adults by children;
where newly introduced, it throws workers upon the streets in great masses; and
as it becomes more highly developed and more productive it discards them in
additional though smaller numbers. </p>

<p>We have hastily sketched in broad outlines the industrial war of capitalists
among themselves. This war has the peculiarity that the battles in it are won
less by recruiting than by discharging the army of workers. The generals (the
capitalists) vie with one another as to who can discharge the greatest number
of industrial soldiers. </p>

<p>The economists tell us, to be sure, that those labourers who have been
rendered superfluous by machinery find new venues of employment. They dare not
assert directly that the same labourers that have been discharged find
situations in new branches of labour. Facts cry out too loudly against this
lie. Strictly speaking, they only maintain that new means of employment will be
found for other sections of the working class; for example, for that portion of
the young generation of labourers who were about to enter upon that branch of
industry which had just been abolished. Of course, this is a great satisfaction
to the disabled labourers. There will be no lack of fresh exploitable blood and
muscle for the Messrs. Capitalists &ndash; the dead may bury their dead. This
consolation seems to be intended more for the comfort of the capitalists
themselves than their labourers. If the whole class of the wage-labourer were
to be annihilated by machinery, how terrible that would be for capital, which,
without wage-labour, ceases to be capital! </p>

<p>But even if we assume that all who are directly forced out of employment by
machinery, as well as all of the rising generation who were waiting for a
chance of employment in the same branch of industry, do actually find some new
employment &ndash; are we to believe that this new employment will pay as high
wages as did the one they have lost? If it did, it would be in contradiction to
the laws of political economy. We have seen how modern industry always tends to
the substitution of the simpler and more subordinate employments for the higher
and more complex ones. How, then, could a mass of workers thrown out of one
branch of industry by machinery find refuge in another branch, unless they were
to be paid more poorly? </p>

<p>An exception to the law has been adduced, namely, the workers who are
employed in the manufacture of machinery itself. As soon as there is in
industry a greater demand for and a greater consumption of machinery, it is
said that the number of machines must necessarily increase; consequently, also,
the manufacture of machines; consequently, also, the employment of workers in
machine manufacture; and the workers employed in this branch of industry are
skilled, even educated, workers. </p>

<p>Since the year 1840 this assertion, which even before that date was only
half-true, has lost all semblance of truth; for the most diverse machines are
now applied to the manufacture of the machines themselves on quite as extensive
a scale as in the manufacture of cotton yarn, and the labourers employed in
machine factories can but play the role of very stupid machines alongside of
the highly ingenious machines. </p>

<p>But in place of the man who has been dismissed by the machine, the factory
may employ, perhaps, three children and one woman! And must not the wages of
the man have previously sufficed for the three children and one woman? Must not
the minimum wages have sufficed for the preservation and propagation of the
race? What, then, do these beloved bourgeois phrases prove? Nothing more than
that now four times as many workers' lives are used up as there were
previously, in order to obtain the livelihood of one working family. </p>

<p>To sum up: the more productive capital grows, the more it extends the
division of labour and the application of machinery; the more the division of
labour and the application of machinery extend, the more does competition
extend among the workers, the more do their wages shrink together. </p>

<p>In addition, the working class is also recruited from the higher strata of
society; a mass of small business men and of people living upon the interest of
their capitals is precipitated into the ranks of the working class, and they
will have nothing else to do than to stretch out their arms alongside of the
arms of the workers. Thus the forest of outstretched arms, begging for work,
grows ever thicker, while the arms themselves grow every leaner. </p>

<p>It is evident that the small manufacturer cannot survive in a struggle in
which the first condition of success is production upon an ever greater scale.
It is evident that the small manufacturers and thereby increasing the number of
candidates for the proletariat &ndash; all this requires no further
elucidation. </p>

<p>Finally, in the same measure in which the capitalists are compelled, by the
movement described above, to exploit the already existing gigantic means of
production on an ever-increasing scale, and for this purpose to set in motion
all the mainsprings of credit, in the same measure do they increase the
industrial earthquakes, in the midst of which the commercial world can preserve
itself only by sacrificing a portion of its wealth, its products, and even its
forces of production, to the gods of the lower world &ndash; in short, the
crises increase. They become more frequent and more violent, if for no other
reason, than for this alone, that in the same measure in which the mass of
products grows, and therefore the needs for extensive markets, in the same
measure does the world market shrink ever more, and ever fewer markets remain
to be exploited, since every previous crisis has subjected to the commerce of
the world a hitherto unconquered or but superficially exploited market. </p>

<p>But capital not only lives upon labour. Like a master, at once distinguished
and barbarous, it drags with it into its grave the corpses of its slaves, whole
hecatombs of workers, who perish in the crises. </p>

<p>We thus see that if capital grows rapidly, competition among the workers
grows with even greater rapidity &ndash; i.e., the means of employment and
subsistence for the working class decrease in proportion even more rapidly;
but, this notwithstanding, the rapid growth of capital is the most favorable
condition for wage-labour. </p>
