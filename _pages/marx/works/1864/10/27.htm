<span class="term">Workingmen:</span></p>
<p>It is a great fact that the misery of the working masses has not diminished
from 1848 to 1864, and yet this period is unrivaled for the development
of its industry and the growth of its commerce. In 1850 a moderate organ
of the British middle class, of more than average information, predicted
that if the exports and imports of England were to rise 50 per cent, English
pauperism would sink to zero. Alas! On April 7, 1864, the Chancellor of
the Exchequer delighted his parliamentary audience by the statement that
the total import and export of England had grown in 1863 &#8220;to 443,955,000
pounds! That astonishing sum about three times the trade of the comparatively
recent epoch of 1843! &#8220;With all that, he was eloquent upon &#8220;poverty&#8221;.
&#8220;Think,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;of those who are on the border of that region,&#8221;
upon &#8220;wages... not increased&#8221;; upon &#8220;human life... in nine cases out of
ten but a struggle of existence! &#8220;He did not speak of the people of Ireland,
gradually replaced by machinery in the north and by sheepwalks in the south,
though even the sheep in that unhappy country are decreasing, it is true,
not at so rapid a rate as the men. He did not repeat what then had been
just betrayed by the highest representation of the upper ten thousand in
a sudden fit of terror. When garrote panic had reached a certain height
the House of Lords caused an inquiry to be made into, and a report to be
published upon, transportation and penal servitude. Out came the murder
in the bulky Blue Book of 1863 and proved it was, by official facts and
figures, that the worst of the convicted criminals, the penal serfs of
England and Scotland, toiled much less and fared far better than the agricultural
laborers of England and Scotland. But this was not all. When, consequent
upon the Civil War in America, the operatives of Lancashire and Cheshire
were thrown upon the streets, the same House of Lords sent to the manufacturing
districts a physician commissioned to investigate into the smallest possible
amount of carbon and nitrogen, to be administered in the cheapest and plainest
form, which on an average might just suffice to &#8220;avert starvation diseases&#8221;.
Dr. Smith, the medical deputy, ascertained that 28,000 grains of carbon
and 1,330 grains of nitrogen were the weekly allowance that would keep
an average adult... just over the level of starvation diseases, and he
found furthermore that quantity pretty nearly to agree with the scanty
nourishment to which the pressure of extreme distress had actually reduced
the cotton operatives <sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1a">(1)</a></sup>. But now mark! The same
learned doctor was later on again deputed by the medical officer of the
Privy Council to enquire into the nourishment of the poorer laboring classes.
The results of his research are embodied in the &#8220;Sixth Report on Public
Health&#8221;, published by order of Parliament in the course of the present
year. What did the doctor discover? That the silk weavers, the needlewomen,
the kid glovers, the stock weavers, and so forth, received on an average,
not even the distress pittance of the cotton operatives, not even the amount
of carbon and nitrogen &#8220;just sufficient to avert starvation diseases&#8221;.
</p>
<p class="indentb"> &#8220;Moreover: &#8212; we quote from the report &#8212; &#8220;as regards the examined
families of the agricultural population, it appeared that more than a fifth
were with less than the estimated sufficiency of carbonaceous food, that
more than one-third were with less than the estimated sufficiency of nitrogeneous
food, and that in three counties (Berkshire, Oxfordshire, and Somersetshire)
insufficiency of nitrogeneous food was the average diet.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="indentb"> &#8220;It must be remembered,&#8221; adds the official report, &#8220;that privation of
food is very reluctantly borne, and that, as a rule, great poorness of
diet will only come when other privations have preceded it.... Even cleanliness
will have been found costly or difficult, and if there still be self-respectful
endeavors to maintain it, every such endeavor will represent additional
pangs of hunger.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="indentb"> &#8220;These are painful reflections, especially when it is remembered that
the poverty to which they advert is not the deserved poverty of idleness;
in all cases it is the poverty of working populations. Indeed the work
which obtains the scanty pittance of food is for the most part excessively
prolonged.&#8221;</p>
<p>
The report brings out the strange and rather unexpected fact:
</p>
<p class="indentb"> &#8220;That of the division of the United Kingdom,&#8221; England, Wales, Scotland,
and Ireland, &#8220;the agricultural population of England,&#8221; the richest division,
 &#8220;is considerably the worst fed&#8221;; but that even the agricultural laborers
of Berkshire, Oxfordshire, and Somersetshire fare better than great numbers
of skilled indoor operatives of the East of London.</p>
<p>
Such are the official statements published by order of Parliament in 1864,
during the millennium of free trade, at a time when the Chancellor of the
Exchequer told the House of Commons that
</p>
<p class="indentb"> &#8220;the average condition of the British laborer has improved in a degree
we know to be extraordinary and unexampled in the history of any country
or any age.&#8221;</p>
<p>
Upon these official congratulations jars the dry remark of the official
Public Health Report:
</p>
<p class="indentb"> &#8220;The public health of a country means the health of its masses, and
the masses will scarcely be healthy unless, to their very base, they be
at least moderately prosperous.&#8221;</p>
<p>
Dazzled by the &#8220;Progress of the Nation&#8221; statistics dancing before his eyes,
the Chancellor of the Exchequer exclaims in wild ecstasy:
</p>
<p class="indentb"> &#8220;From 1842 to 1852, the taxable income of the country increased by
6 per cent; in the eight years from 1853 to 1861, it has increased from
the basis taken in 1853, 20 per cent! The fact is so astonishing to be
almost incredible! ... This intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power,&#8221;
adds Mr. Gladstone, &#8220;is entirely confined to classes of property.&#8221;</p>
<p>
If you want to know under what conditions of broken health, tainted morals,
and mental ruin that &#8220;intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power...
entirely confined to classes of property&#8221; was, and is, being produced by
the classes of labor, look to the picture hung up in the last Public Health
Report of the workshops of tailors, printers, and dressmakers! Compare
the &#8220;Report of the <a href="../../../../../history/england/government/1862/childrens-commission-report.pdf">
Children&#8217;s Employment Commission</a>&#8221; of 1863, where it
states, for instance, that
</p>
<p class="indentb"> &#8220;the potters as a class, both men and women, represent a much degenerated
population, both physically and mentally&#8221;, that &#8220;the unhealthy child is
an unhealthy parent in his turn&#8221;, that &#8220;a progressive deterioration of
the race must go on&#8221;, and that &#8220;the degenerescence of the population of
Staffordshire would be even greater were it not for the constant recruiting
from the adjacent country, and the intermarriage with more healthy races.&#8221;</p>
<p>
Glance at Mr. Tremenheere&#8217;s Blue Book of the &#8220;Grievances Complained of
by the Journeymen Bakers&#8221;! And who has not shuddered at the paradoxic made
by the inspectors of factories, and illustrated by the Registrar General,
that the Lancashire operatives, while put upon the distress pittance of
food, were actually improving in health, because of their temporary exclusion
by the cotton famine from the cotton factory, and the mortality of the
children was decreasing, because their mothers were now at last allowed
to give them, instead of Godrey&#8217;s cordial, their own breasts.
</p>
<p>Again, reverse the medal! The income and property tax returns laid before
the House of Commons on July 20, 1864, teach us that the persons with yearly
incomes valued by the tax gatherer of 50,000 pounds and upwards had, from
April 5, 1862, to April 5, 1863, been joined by a dozen and one, their
number having increased in that single year from 67 to 80. The same returns
disclose the fact that about 3,000 persons divide among themselves a yearly
income of about 25,000,000 pounds sterling, rather more than the total
revenue doled out annually to the whole mass of the agricultural laborers
of England and Wales. Open the census of 1861 and you will find that the
number of male landed proprietors of England and Wales has decreased from
16,934 in 1851 to 15,066 in 1861, so that the concentration of land had
grown in 10 years 11 per cent. If the concentration of the soil of the
country in a few hands proceeds at the same rate, the land question will
become singularly simplified, as it had become in the Roman Empire when
Nero grinned at the discovery that half of the province of Africa was owned
by six gentlemen.
</p>
<p>We have dwelt so long upon these facts &#8220;so astonishing to be almost
incredible&#8221; because England heads the Europe of commerce and industry.
It will be remembered that some months ago one of the refugee sons of Louis
Philippe publicly congratulated the English agricultural laborer on the
superiority of his lot over that of his less florid comrade on the other
side of the Channel. Indeed, with local colors changed, and on a scale
somewhat contracted, the English facts reproduce themselves in all the
industrious and progressive countries of the Continent. In all of them
there has taken place, since 1848, an unheard-of development of industry,
and an unheard-of expansion of imports and exports. In all of them, as
in England, a minority of the working classes got their real wages somewhat
advanced; while in most cases the monetary rise of wages denoted no more
a real access of comforts than the inmate of the metropolitan poorhouse
or orphan asylum, for instance, was in the least benefited by his first
necessaries costing &pound;9 15s. 8d. in 1861 against &pound;7 7s. 4d. in 1852. Everywhere
the great mass of the working classes were sinking down to a lower depth,
at the same rate at least that those above them were rising in the social
scale. In all countries of Europe it has now become a truth demonstrable
to every unprejudiced mind, and only decried by those whose interest it
is to hedge other people in a fool&#8217;s paradise, that no improvement of machinery,
no appliance of science to production, no contrivances of communication,
no new colonies, no emigration, no opening of markets, no free trade, not
all these things put together, will do away with the miseries of the industrious
masses; but that, on the present false base, every fresh development of
the productive powers of labor must tend to deepen social contrasts and
point social antagonisms. Death of starvation rose almost to the rank of
an institution, during this intoxicating epoch of economical progress,
in the metropolis of the British empire. That epoch is marked in the annals
of the world by the quickened return, the widening compass, and the deadlier
effects of the social pest called a commercial and industrial crisis.
</p>
<p>After the failure of the Revolution of 1848, all party organizations
and party journals of the working classes were, on the Continent, crushed
by the iron hand of force, the most advanced sons of labor fled in despair
to the transatlantic republic, and the short-lived dreams of emancipation
vanished before an epoch of industrial fever, moral marasm, and political
reaction. The defeat of the continental working classes, partly owed to
the diplomacy of the English government, acting then as now in fraternal
solidarity with the Cabinet of St. Petersburg, soon spread its contagious
effects to this side of the Channel. While the rout of their continental
brethren unmanned the English working classes, and broke their faith in
their own cause, it restored to the landlord and the money lord their somewhat
shaken confidence. They insolently withdrew concessions already advertised.
The discoveries of new gold lands led to an immense exodus, leaving an
irreparable void in the ranks of the British proletariat. Others of its
formerly active members were caught by the temporary bribe of greater work
and wages, and turned into &#8220;political blacks&#8221;. All the efforts made at
keeping up, of remodeling, the Chartist movement failed signally; the press
organs of the working class died one by one of the apathy of the masses,
and in point of fact never before seemed the English working class so thoroughly
reconciled to a state of political nullity. If, then, there had been no
solidarity of action between the British and the continental working classes,
there was, at all events, a solidarity of defeat.
</p>
<p>And yet the period passed since the Revolutions of 1848 has not been
without its compensating features. We shall here only point to two great
factors.
</p>
<p>After a 30 years&#8217; struggle, fought with almost admirable perseverance,
the English working classes, improving a momentaneous split between the
landlords and money lords, succeeded in carrying the Ten Hours&#8217; Bill. The
immense physical, moral, and intellectual benefits hence accruing to the
factory operatives, half-yearly chronicled in the reports of the inspectors
of factories, are now acknowledged on all sides. Most of the continental
governments had to accept the English Factory Act in more or less modified
forms, and the English Parliament itself is every year compelled to enlarge
its sphere of action. But besides its practical import, there was something
else to exalt the marvelous success of this workingmen&#8217;s measure. Through
their most notorious organs of science, such as Dr. Ure, Professor Senior,
and other sages of that stamp, the middle class had predicted, and to their
heart&#8217;s content proved, that any legal restriction of the hours of labor
must sound the death knell of British industry, which, vampirelike, could
but live by sucking blood, and children&#8217;s blood, too. In olden times, child
murder was a mysterious rite of the religion of Moloch, but it was practiced
on some very solemn occassions only, once a year perhaps, and then Moloch
had no exclusive bias for the children of the poor. This struggle about
the legal restriction of the hours of labor raged the more fiercely since,
apart from frightened avarice, it told indeed upon the great contest between
the blind rule of the supply and demand laws which form the political economy
of the middle class, and social production controlled by social foresight,
which forms the political economy of the working class. Hence the Ten Hours&#8217;
Bill was not only a great practical success; it was the victory of a principle;
it was the first time that in broad daylight the political economy of the
middle class succumbed to the political economy of the working class.
</p>
<p>But there was in store a still greater victory of the political economy
of labor over the political economy of property. We speak of the co-operative
movement, especially the co-operative factories raised by the unassisted
efforts of a few bold &#8220;hands&#8221;. The value of these great social experiments
cannot be overrated. By deed instead of by argument, they have shown that
production on a large scale, and in accord with the behests of modern science,
may be carried on without the existence of a class of masters employing
a class of hands; that to bear fruit, the means of labor need not be monopolized
as a means of dominion over, and of extortion against, the laboring man
himself; and that, like slave labor, like serf labor, hired labor is but
a transitory and inferior form, destined to disappear before associated
labor plying its toil with a willing hand, a ready mind, and a joyous heart.
In England, the seeds of the co-operative system were sown by Robert Owen;
the workingmen&#8217;s experiments tried on the Continent were, in fact, the
practical upshot of the theories, not invented, but loudly proclaimed,
in 1848.
</p>
<p>At the same time the experience of the period from 1848 to 1864 has
proved beyond doubt that, however, excellent in principle and however useful
in practice, co-operative labor, if kept within the narrow circle of the
casual efforts of private workmen, will never be able to arrest the growth
in geometrical progression of monopoly, to free the masses, nor even to
perceptibly lighten the burden of their miseries. It is perhaps for this
very reason that plausible noblemen, philanthropic middle-class spouters,
and even keep political economists have all at once turned nauseously complimentary
to the very co-operative labor system they had vainly tried to nip in the
bud by deriding it as the utopia of the dreamer, or stigmatizing it as
the sacrilege of the socialist. To save the industrious masses, co-operative
labor ought to be developed to national dimensions, and, consequently,
to be fostered by national means. Yet the lords of the land and the lords
of capital will always use their political privileges for the defense and
perpetuation of their economic monopolies. So far from promoting, they
will continue to lay every possible impediment in the way of the emancipation
of labor. Remember the sneer with which, last session, Lord Palmerston
put down the advocated of the Irish Tenants&#8217; Right Bill. The House of Commons,
cried he, is a house of landed proprietors. To conquer political power
has, therefore, become the great duty of the working classes. They seem
to have comprehended this, for in England, Germany, Italy, and France,
there have taken place simultaneous revivals, and simultaneous efforts
are being made at the political organization of the workingmen&#8217;s party.
</p>
<p>One element of success they possess &#8212; numbers; but numbers weigh
in the balance only if united by combination and led by knowledge. Past
experience has shown how disregard of that bond of brotherhood which ought
to exist between the workmen of different countries, and incite them to
stand firmly by each other in all their struggles for emancipation, will
be chastised by the common discomfiture of their incoherent efforts. This
thought prompted the workingmen of different countries assembled on September
28, 1864, in public meeting at St. Martin&#8217;s Hall, to found the International
Association.
</p>
<p>Another conviction swayed that meeting.
</p>
<p>If the emancipation of the working classes requires their fraternal
concurrence, how are they to fulfill that great mission with a foreign
policy in pursuit of criminal designs, playing upon national prejudices,
and squandering in piratical wars the people&#8217;s blood and treasure? It was
not the wisdom of the ruling classes, but the heroic resistance to their
criminal folly by the working classes of England, that saved the west of
Europe from plunging headlong into an infamous crusade for the perpetuation
and propagation of slavery on the other side of the Atlantic. The shameless
approval, mock sympathy, or idiotic indifference with which the upper classes
of Europe have witnessed the mountain fortress of the Caucasus falling
a prey to, and heroic Poland being assassinated by, Russia: the immense
and unresisted encroachments of that barbarous power, whose head is in
St. Petersburg, and whose hands are in every cabinet of Europe, have taught
the working classes the duty to master themselves the mysteries of international
politics; to watch the diplomatic acts of their respective governments;
to counteract them, if necessary, by all means in their power; when unable
to prevent, to combine in simultaneous denunciations, and to vindicate
the simple laws or morals and justice, which ought to govern the relations
of private individuals, as the rules paramount of the intercourse of nations.
</p>
<p>The fight for such a foreign policy forms part of the general struggle
for the emancipation of the working classes.
</p>
<p>Proletarians of all countries, unite!

We need hardly remind the reader that, apart from the elements of water
and certain inorganic substances, carbon and nitrogen form the raw materials
of human food. However, to nourish the human system, these simple chemical
constituents must be supplied in the form of vegetable or animal substances.
Potatoes, for instance, contain mainly carbon, while wheaten bread contains
carbonaceous and nitrogenous substances in a due proportion. &#8212; K.M.
