<h1>Theses On Feuerbach</h1>
<hr class="end"><p class="information">
<span class="info">Written</span>: by Marx in Brussels in the spring of 1845, under the title &#8220;1) <em>ad</em> Feuerbach&#8221;;<br>
Marx&#8217;s original text was first published in 1924, in German and in Russian translation, by the Institute of Marxism-Leninism in <em>Marx-Engels Archives, </em>Book I, Moscow. The English translation was first published in the Lawrence and Wishart edition of <em>The German Ideology</em>&#160; in 1938. <br>
The most widely known version of the <i>Theses</i> is that based on Engels&#8217; edited version, published as an appendix to his <em>Ludwig Feuerbach</em> in 1888, where he gave it the title <em>Theses on Feuerbach</em>;<br>
<span class="info">Translated</span>: by Cyril Smith 2002, based on work done jointly with Don Cuckson.</p>

<h3>1</h3>
<p> The main defect of all hitherto-existing materialism &#8212; that of Feuerbach included &#8212; is that the Object <span class="context">[<em>der Gegenstand</em>]</span>, actuality, sensuousness, are conceived only in the form of the object <span class="context">[<em>Objekts</em>]</span>, or of contemplation <span class="context">[<em>Anschauung</em>]</span>, but not as human sensuous activity, practice <span class="context">[<em>Praxis</em>]</span>, not subjectively. Hence it happened that the active side, in opposition to materialism, was developed by idealism &#8212; but only abstractly, since, of course, idealism does not know real, sensuous activity as such. <a name="002"></a>Feuerbach wants sensuous objects  <span class="context">[<em>Objekte</em>]</span>, differentiated from thought-objects, but he does not conceive human activity itself as objective <span class="context">[<em>gegenständliche</em>]</span> activity. In <em>The Essence of Christianity</em> <span class="context">[<em>Das Wesen des Christenthums</em>]</span>, he therefore regards the theoretical attitude as the only genuinely human attitude, while practice <span class="context">[<em>Praxis</em>]</span> is conceived and defined only in its dirty-Jewish form of appearance <span class="context">[<em>Erscheinungsform</em>]</span><sup class="enote"><a href="#jewish">[1]</a></sup>. Hence he does not grasp the significance of &#8216;revolutionary&#8217;, of &#8216;practical-critical&#8217;, activity.</p>
<a name="003"></a>
<h3>2</h3>
<p> The question whether objective truth can be attributed to human thinking is not a question of theory but is a <STRONG>practical</STRONG> question. Man must prove the truth, <em>i.e.</em>, the reality and power, the this-sidedness <span class="context">[<em>Diesseitigkeit</em>]</span> of his thinking, in practice. The dispute over the reality or non-reality of thinking which is isolated from practice is a purely scholastic question.</p>
<a name="004"></a>
<h3>3</h3>
<p> The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing, and that, therefore, changed men are products of changed circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets that it is men who change circumstances and that the educator must himself be educated. Hence this doctrine is bound to divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to society. <a name="005"></a>The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self-change <span class="context">[<em>Selbstveränderung</em>]</span> can be conceived and rationally understood only as <STRONG>revolutionary practice</STRONG>.</p>
<a name="006"></a>
<h3>4</h3>
<p> Feuerbach starts off from the fact of religious self-estrangement <span class="context">[<em>Selbstentfremdung</em>]</span>, of the duplication of the world into a religious, imaginary world, and a secular <span class="context">[<em>weltliche</em>]</span> one. His work consists in resolving the religious world into its secular basis. He overlooks the fact that after completing this work, the chief thing still remains to be done. <a name="007"></a>For the fact that the secular basis lifts off from itself and establishes itself in the clouds as an independent realm can only be explained by the inner strife and intrinsic contradictoriness of this secular basis. The latter must itself be understood in its contradiction and then, by the removal of the contradiction, revolutionised. Thus, for instance, once the earthly family is discovered to be the secret of the holy family, the former must itself be annihilated <span class="context">[<em>vernichtet</em>]</span> theoretically and practically.</p>
<a name="008"></a>
<h3>5</h3>
<p> Feuerbach, not satisfied with <STRONG>abstract thinking</STRONG>, wants <STRONG>sensuous contemplation</STRONG> <span class="context">[<em>Anschauung</em>]</span>; but he does not conceive sensuousness as <STRONG>practical</STRONG>, human-sensuous activity.</p>
<a name="009"></a>
<h3>6</h3>
<p> Feuerbach resolves the essence of religion into the essence of man <span class="context">[<em>menschliche Wesen</em> = &#8216;human nature&#8217;]</span>. But the essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. <a name="010"></a>In reality, it is the ensemble of the social relations. <a name="011"></a>Feuerbach, who does not enter upon a criticism of this real essence is hence obliged: </p>
<p class="indentb" style="text-indent: -20px;"><a name="012"></a>1. To abstract from the historical process and to define the religious  sentiment regarded by itself, and to presuppose an abstract &#8212; isolated - human individual.</p>
<p class="indentb" style="text-indent: -20px;"><a name="013"></a>2.  The essence therefore can by him only be regarded as &#8216;species&#8217;, as an inner &#8216;dumb&#8217; generality which unites many individuals only in a <STRONG>natural</STRONG> way.</p>
<a name="014"></a>
<h3>7</h3>
<p> Feuerbach consequently does not see that the &#8216;religious sentiment&#8217; is itself a <STRONG>social product</STRONG>, and that the abstract individual that he analyses belongs in reality to a particular social form.</p>
<a name="015"></a>
<h3>8</h3>
<p> All social life is essentially <STRONG>practical</STRONG>. All mysteries which lead theory to mysticism find their rational solution in human practice and in the comprehension of this practice.</p>
<a name="016"></a>
<h3>9</h3>
<p> The highest point reached by contemplative <span class="context">[<em>anschauende</em>]</span> materialism, that is, materialism which does not comprehend sensuousness as practical activity, is the contemplation of single individuals and of civil society <span class="context">[<em>bürgerlichen Gesellschaft</em>]</span>.</p>
<a name="017"></a>
<h3>10</h3>
<p> The standpoint of the old materialism is civil society; the standpoint of the new is human society or social humanity.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<a name="018"></a>
<h3>11</h3>
<p> Philosophers have hitherto only <i>interpreted</i> the world in various ways; the point is to <i>change</i> it.</p>
