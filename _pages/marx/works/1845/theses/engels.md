> The chief defect of all hitherto existing materialism -- that of
> Feuerbach included -- is that the things \[*Gegenstand*\], reality,
> sensuousness, are conceived only in the form of the *object* or of
> *contemplation*, but not as *sensuous human activity, practice*, not
> subjectively. Hence, it happened that the *active* side, in
> coradistinction to materialism, was set forth by idealism -- but only
> abstractly, since, of course, idealism does not know real, sensuous
> activity as such. []{#002} Feuerbach wants sensuous objects, really
> distinct from the conceptual objects, but he does not conceive human
> activity itself as *objective* activity. Hence, in [Das Wesen des
> Christenthums](../../../../../reference/archive/feuerbach/works/essence/index.htm),
> he therefore regards the theoretical attitude as the only genuinely
> human attitude, while practice is conceived and defined only in its
> dirty-Jewish form of appearance. Hence he does not grasp the
> significance of "revolutionary", of "practical-critical", activity.

> The question whether objective truth can be attributed to human
> thinking is not a question of theory but is a practical question. Man

> of his thinking in practice. The dispute over the reality or
> non-reality of thinking that is isolates from practice is a purely
> scholastic question.

> The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and
> upbringing, and that, therefore, changed men are products of other
> circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets that it is men who
> change circumstances and that the educator must himself be educated.
> Hence, this doctrine is bound to divide society into two parts, one of
> which is superior to society (in Robert Owen for example). []{#005}
>
> The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity

> Feuerbach starts out from the fact of religious self-estrangement, of
> the duplication of the world into a religious, imaginary world and a
> real one. His work consists in resolving the religious world into its
> secular basis. []{#007} He overlooks the fact that after completing
> this work, the chief thing stil remains to be done. For the fact that
> the secular basis lifts off from itself from itself and establishes
> itself in the clouds as an independent realm can only be explained by
> the inner strife and intrinsic contradictoriness of this secular
> basis. The latter must itself, therefore, first be understood in its
> contradiction and then, by the removal of the contradiction,
> revolutionized in practice. Thus, for instance, once the earthly
> family is discovered to be the secret of the holy family, the former
> must then itself be destroyed in theory and transformed in practice.

> Feuerbach resolves the essence of religion into the essence of man.
> But the essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each single
> individual. []{#010} In its reality it is the ensemble of the social
> relations. []{#011}

> Feuerbach, who does not enter upon a criticism of this real essence,
> is hence obliged: []{#012}
>
> 1.  To abstract from the historical process and to define the
>     religious sentiment \[*GemÃ¼t*\] regarded by itself and to
>     presuppose an abstract -- *isolated* -- human individual. []{#013}
> 2.  The essence of man, therefore, can with him be regarded only as
>     "species", as an inner, mute general character which unites the
>     many individuals only *in a natural way*.
