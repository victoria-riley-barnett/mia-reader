[Questions for discussion:]{.term style="color: #006600;"}\
[ 1. Surely the whole point of materialism is that the thing exists
independently of consciousness, or practice for that matter? Isn't this
statement by Marx idealist?\
2. How can Marx praise the idealists for developing the *active* side?
Isn't it the materialists that are trying to change the world rather
than relying on "ideas"?\
3. What *is* the significance of "revolutionary", of
"practical-critical", activity?\

# [2.](theses.htm#003)

[Questions for discussion:]{.term style="color: #006600;"}\
[ 4. If "the question whether objective truth can be attributed to human
thinking is not a question of theory but is a practical question", what
*is* the place for theory? ]{.date}

# [3.](theses.htm#004)

[Questions for discussion:]{.term style="color: #006600;"}\
[ 5. Is the "materialist doctrine" referred to a valid one? Why does
Marx say that it divides society into two parts? Can you give examples
from present-day politics of this kind of thinking and how it must
"divide society into two parts"?\
6. What exactly does Marx means, then, by "revolutionary practice"?
]{.date}

# [4.](theses.htm#006)

[Questions for discussion:]{.term style="color: #006600;"}\
[ 7. Can you give an example of "resolving the religious world into its
secular basis"?\
8. What does this Thesis tell us about how the hold of bourgeois
ideology on the working class can be broken, other than by waiting for
the revolution to abolish capital?\

[Questions for discussion:]{.term style="color: #006600;"}\
[ 9. Can you justify the assertion that "Sensuousness is practical,
human-sensuous activity"?\
]{.date}

# [6.](theses.htm#009)

[Questions for discussion:]{.term style="color: #006600;"}\
[ 10. What is meant by "the human essence is \... the ensemble of the
social relations"?\
11. How does Feuerbach's position "presuppose an abstract - isolated -
human individual"?\
]{.date}

# [7.](theses.htm#014)

[Questions for discussion:]{.term style="color: #006600;"}\
[ 12. Why does Marx say a "**particular** form of society"?\
]{.date}

# [8.](theses.htm#015)

[Questions for discussion:]{.term style="color: #006600;"}\
[ 13. "All mysteries which lead theory to mysticism find their rational
solution in human practice and in the comprehension of this practice"
But surely if we want to understand Nature we must study Nature, not
human practice. Isn't this a positivist or idealist position?\
]{.date}

# [9.](theses.htm#016)

[Questions for discussion:]{.term style="color: #006600;"}\
[ 14. Why does "contemplative materialism" lead to "contemplation of
single individuals and of civil society"?\
15. What is the specific thing that the *idealists*, who as Marx said,
have "developed the active side", have been able to bring out, which
gets away from "contemplation of single individuals and of civil
society"?\
]{.date}

# [10.](theses.htm#017)

[Questions for discussion:]{.term style="color: #006600;"}\
[ 16. What can be meant by "the standpoint of social humanity"?\
]{.date}

# [11.](theses.htm#018)

[Questions for discussion:]{.term style="color: #006600;"}\
[ 17. Either Thesis XI is a declaration of the uselessness of
philosophy, and interpreting the world in general, or it is saying
something more. In the light of the previous ten theses, what do you
think it means?\
