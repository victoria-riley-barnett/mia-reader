"When I visited Marx in Paris in the summer of 1844, our complete
agreement in all theoretical fields became evident and our joint work
dates from that time."\
*Frederick Engels*

[Written:]{.info} between September and November 1844;\
[First Published:]{.info} The book was first published in February 1845,
Frankfurt am Main. The work was never translated into English in either
man's lifetime;\
[Translated:]{.info} This 1956 English translation is by Richard Dixon,
and is taken from the 1845 German edition;\

During Engels\' short stay in Paris in 1844, Marx suggested the two of
them should write a critique of the rage of their day, the Young
Hegelians. In the doing was born the first joint writing project between
the two men \-- and a life-long association that would change the world.

At the end of August, 1844, Engels passed through Paris, *en route* to
his employment in Manchester, England, from visiting his family in
Barmen (Germany). During 10 days in the French capital, he met Marx (for
the second time).

After talking, they began drawing up plans for a book about the Young
Hegelian trend of thought very popular in academic circles. Agreeing to
co-author the Foreword, they divided up the other sections. Engels
finished his assigned chapters before leaving Paris. Marx had the larger
share of work, and he completed it by the end of November 1844. (Marx
would draw from his Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, on which
he\'d been working the spring and summer of 1844.)

The foremost title line --- "The Holy Family" --- was added at the
suggestion of the book publisher Lowenthal. It\'s a sarcastic reference
to the Bauer brothers and their supporters.

The book made something of a splash in the newspapers. One paper noted,
that it expressed socialist views since it criticised the "inadequacy of
any half-measures directed at eliminating the social ailments of our
time." The conservative press immediately recognized the radical
elements inherent in its many arguments. One paper wrote that, in *The
Holy Family*, "every line preaches revolt\... against the state, the
church, the family, legality, religion and property." It also noted that
"prominence is given to the most radical and the most open communism,
and this is all the more dangerous as Mr. Marx cannot be denied either
extremely broad knowledge or the ability to make use of the polemical
arsenal of Hegel's logic, what is customarily called 'iron logic.'ð”„¢

Lenin would later claim this work laid the foundations for what would
develop into a scientific revolutionary materialist socialism.

Bruno Bauer attempted to rebut the book in the article "Charakteristik
Ludwig Feuerbachs" --- which was published in *Wigand's
Vierteljahrsschrift*, Leipzig 1845. Bauer essentially claimed that Marx
and Engels misunderstood what he was really saying. Marx would reply to
that article with his own article --- published in the journal
*Gesellschaftsspiegel*, Elberfeld, January 1846. And the matter was also
discussed in chapter 2 of *The German Ideology*.
