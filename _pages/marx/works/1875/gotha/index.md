#### Background

Critique of the Gotha Programme is a critique of the draft programme of
the United Workers\' Party of Germany. In this document Marx address the
dictatorship of the proletariat, the period of transition from
capitalism to communism, the two phases of communist society, the
production and distribution of the social goods, proletarian
internationalism, and the party of the working class.

Lenin later wrote:

The great significance of Marx\'s explanation is, that here too, he
consistently applies materialist dialectics, the theory of development,
and regards communism as something which develops *out of* capitalism.
Instead of scholastically invented, \'concocted\' definitions and
fruitless disputes over words (What is socialism? What is communism?),
Marx gives analysis of what might be called the stages of the economic
maturity of communism.

(Lenin Collected Works, Volume 25, p. 471)

Engels wrote a foreword when the document was first published in 1891.
Together with the *Critique of the Gotha Programme* Engels published
[Marx\'s letter to Bracke](../../1875/letters/75_05_05.htm), directly
bound up with the work.
