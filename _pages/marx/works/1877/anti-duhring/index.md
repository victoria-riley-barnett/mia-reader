Formerly known as *Herr Eugen Dühring\'s Revolution in Science*, Engels'
*Anti-Dühring* is a popular and enduring work which, as Engels wrote to
Marx, was an attempt "to produce an encyclopaedic survey of our
conception of the philosophical, natural-science and historical
problems."

[]{#001}

Marx and Engels first became aware of Professor Dühring with his
December 1867 review of *Capital*, published in *Ergänzungsblätter*.
They exchanged a series of letters about him from January-March 1868.

He was largely forgotten until the mid-1870s, at which time Dühring
entered Germany\'s political foreground. German Social-Democrats were
influenced by both his *Kritische Geschichte der Nationalökonomie und
des Sozialismus* and *Cursus der Philosophie als streng
wissenschaftlicher Weltanschauung und Lebensgestaltung*. Among his
readers were included Johann Most, Friedrich Wilhelm Fritzsche, Eduard
Bernstein --- and even August Bebel for a brief period.

In March 1874, the Social-Democratic Workers' Party paper *Volksstaat*
ran an anonymous article (actually penned by Bebel) favorably reviewing
one of Dühring\'s books.

On both February 1 and April 21, 1875, Liebknecht encouraged Engels to
take Dühring head-on in the pages of the *Volksstaat.* In February 1876,
Engels fired an opening salvo with his *Volksstaat* article "Prussian
Vodka in the German Reichstag".

On May 24, 1876, Engels wrote Marx, saying there was cause to initiate a
campaign against the spread of Dühring's views. Marx replied the next
day, saying Dühring himself should be sharply criticised. So Engels put
aside his work on what would later become known as the book *Dialectics
of Nature*. On May 28, he outlined to Marx the general strategy he
planned to take against Dühring. It would take over two years to
complete.

The book breaks into three distinct parts:

[Part I: Philosophy]{.term} --- Written mainly between September 1876
and January 1877. Published as a series of articles entitled *Herrn
Eugen Dühring\'s Umwälzung der Philosophie* in *Vorwärts* between
January and May 1877. Later, beginning in 1878, with the first separate
edition, the first two chapters of this part were made into an
independent general introduction to all three parts.

[Part II: Political Economy]{.term} --- Written mainly between June and
August 1877. (The last chapter was actually written by Marx.) Published
under the title *Herrn Eugen Dühring\'s Umwälzung der politischen
Oekonomie* in *Wissenschaftliche Beilage* and in the supplement to
*Vorwärts* between July and December 1877.

[Part III: Socialism]{.term} --- Written mainly between August 1877 and
April 1878. Published as *Herrn Eugen Dühring\'s Umwälzung des
Sozialismus* in the supplement to *Vorwärts* between May and July 1878.

The *Vorwärts* serials elicited objections from Dühring\'s loyal
adherents: during the May 27 1877 congress of the Socialist Workers\'
Party of Germany, they attempted to ban the on-going publication of it
in the Party paper. Indeed, the sporadic delays in publication were
largely due to their efforts.

In July 1877, Part I was published as a pamphlet. In July 1878, Parts II
and III were combined into a second pamphlet.

In early July 1878, the complete work was first published as a book ---
with an added preface by Engels. In October 1878, Germany's
Anti-Socialist Law was instituted and *Anti-Dühring* was banned along
with Engels' other works. In 1886, a second edition appeared in Zurich.
The third, revised and supplemented edition was published in Stuttgart,
in 1894, i.e., after the Anti-Socialist Law was repealed (1890). This
was the last edition during Engels\' lifetime. It was translated into
English for the first time in 1907, in Chicago.

In 1880, at Paul Lafargue\'s request, Engels took three chapters of
*Anti-Dühring* and created one would become one of the most popular
socialist pamphlets in the world: *Socialism: Utopian and Scientific*.
