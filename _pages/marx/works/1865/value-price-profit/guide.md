[ 1. Marx refers to Weston\'s argument that the total portion of the
national product accruing to wages must remain constant. The modern
expression of this theory is "that wage rises cause inflation", and that
therefore any increase in wages will cause inflation and reduce real
wages back to where they started. How would you respond to this version
of Weston\'s argument in terms of inflation?\

[ 1. By what line of argument does Marx prove that a rise in wages will
bring about an increase in the mass of commodities which the workers
will be able to purchase with their now increased wages?\
2. Why does not Marx accept the idea that the price at which a commodity
is sold is determined by the total cost of production, from which it
follows that if the wage costs rise then the total price must rise?\
3. What do you think explains the *fall* in prices that Marx alleges
resulted from the overall increase in agricultural wages and shortening
of the working day?\

working solely for the benefit of the employer?\

a profit, but the worker only gets enough to live on, in this system of
*wage-labour*? Why don\'t the workers get a share of the profits?\

[Questions for discussion:]{.term style="color: #006600;"}\
[ 1. Why does Marx say that "the value of labour" is *senseless*?\
2. According to bourgeois economics, the worker sells her \"services\"
to the capitalist, just the same as the capitalist in the service
sector; both sell their services and earn a revenue from the sale at the
going rate of profit. What\'s wrong with this argument?\
3. How is the value of a *service* determined? Surely eight hours labour
in the form of a service (e.g. if you hire an electrician to re-wire
your house) is worth eight hours. But how could be worth any more than
eight hours wages for the given trade (e.g. what an electrician working
for a big building firm would get paid)?\
