> "The economists of the seventeenth century, e.g., always begin with
> the living whole, with population, nation, state, several states,
> etc.; but they always conclude by discovering through analysis a small
> number of determinant, abstract, general relations such as division of
> labour, money, value, etc. As soon as these individual moments had
> been more or less firmly established and abstracted, there began the
> economic systems, which ascended from the simple relations, such as
> labour, division of labour, need, exchange value, to the level of the
> state, exchange between nations and the world market. The latter is
> obviously the scientifically correct method. The concrete is concrete
> because it is the concentration of many determinations, hence unity of
> the diverse. It appears in the process of thinking, therefore, as a
> process of concentration, as a result, not as a point of departure,
> even though it is the point of departure in reality and hence also the
> point of departure for observation \[Anschauung\] and conception.
> Along the first path the full conception was evaporated to yield an
> abstract determination; along the second, the abstract determinations
> lead towards a reproduction of the concrete by way of thought."

> "In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter
> Into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely
> relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the
> development of their material forces of production. The totality of
> these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of
> society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political
> superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social
> consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the
> general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not
> the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their
> social existence that determines their consciousness."
