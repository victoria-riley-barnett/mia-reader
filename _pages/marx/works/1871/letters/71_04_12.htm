<h4>[London] April 12, 1871</h4>
<p class="sig"><b>Dear Kugelmann</b></p>
<p>Your &#8216;medical advice&#8217; was effective in so far as I have consulted my Dr Maddison and have for the present put myself under his care. He says however that my lungs are in excellent condition and the cough is due to bronchitis, etc. It probably also affects the liver.</p>
<p>Yesterday we received the by no means soothing news that Lafargue (not Laura) was at present in Paris. <sup class="enote"><a href="#n1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p class="fst">
If you look at the last chapter of my <a href="../../1852/18th-brumaire/index.htm">Eighteenth Brumaire</a> you will
find that I say that the next attempt of the French revolution will be
no longer, as before, to transfer the bureaucratic-military machine from
one hand to another, but to <EM>smash</EM> it, and this is essential for every
real people's revolution on the Continent. And this is what our
heroic Party comrades in Paris are attempting.  What elasticity, what
historical initiative, what a capacity for sacrifice in these Parisians!
After six months of hunger and ruin, caused rather by internal treachery
than by the external enemy, they rise, beneath Prussian bayonets, as if
there had never been a war between France and Germany and the enemy were
not at the gates of Paris.  History has no like example of a like
greatness.  If they are defeated only their &#8220;good nature&#8221; will be to
blame.  They should have marched at once on Versailles, after first
Vinoy and then the reactionary section of the Paris National Guard had
themselves retreated.  The right moment was missed because of
conscientious scruples.  They did not want to <EM>start the civil war</EM>, as
if that mischievous <EM>abortion</EM> Thiers had not already started the civil
war with his attempt to disarm Paris.  Second mistake: The Central
Committee surrendered its power too soon, to make way for the Commune. 
Again from a too &#8220;honorable&#8221; scrupulosity! However that may be, the
present rising in Paris &#8211; even if it be crushed by the wolves, swine
and vile curs of the old society &#8211; is the most glorious deed of our
Party since the June insurrection in Paris.  Compare these Parisians,
storming heaven, with the slave to heaven of the German-Prussian Holy
Roman Empire, with its posthumous masquerades reeking of the barracks,
the Church, cabbage-<EM>junkerdom</EM> and above all, of the philistine. 
<P class="fst">
A propos.  In the official publication of the list of those receiving
direct subsidies from Louis Bonaparte's treasury there is a note that
Vogt received 40,000 francs in August 1859.  I have informed Liebknecht
of the <EM>fait</EM>, for further use. </p>
<p>You can send me Haxthausen&#8217;s <sup class="enote"><a href="#n2">[2]</a></sup> book for <em>lately </em>I have been receiving undamaged various pamphlets, etc, not only from Germany but even from Petersburg.</p>
<p>Thanks for the various newspapers you sent me. (Please let me have more of them, for I want to write something about Germany, the Reichstag, etc.)</p>
<p>Best regards to the Countess and Käuzchen. <sup class="enote"><a href="#n3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p class="sig">Yours</p>
