> Has that which was declared in the first Address not come to pass:
> that if Germany's defensive war against Louis Bonaparte degenerated
> into a war of conquest against the French people, all the misfortunes
> which befell Germany after the so-called wars of
> liberation^[\[B\]](#B){#Bb}^ would revive again with renewed

> the anti-socialist campaign taking the place of the prosecutions of
> demagogues,^[\[C\]](#C){#Cb}^ with the same arbitrary police measures
> and with literally the same staggering interpretations of the law?

> And has not [the prophecy](ch02.htm#Db) been proved to the letter that
> the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine would \"force France into the arms
> of Russia,\" and that after this annexation Germany must either become
> the avowed tool of Russia, or must, after some short respite, arm for
> a new war, and, moreover, \"a race war against the combined Slavonic
> and Roman races\"? Has not the annexation of the French provinces
> driven France into the arms of Russia? Has not Bismarck for fully 20
> years vainly wooed the favor of the tsar, wooed it with services even
> more lowly than those which little Prussia, before it became the
> \"first power in Europe,\" was wont to lay at Holy Russia's feet? And
> is there not every day hanging over our heads the Damocles' sword of
> war, on the first day of which all the chartered covenants of princes
> will be scattered like chaff; a war of which nothing is certain but
> the absolute uncertainty of its outcome; a race war which will subject
> the whole of Europe to devastation by 15 or 20 million armed men, and
> is only not already raging because even the strongest of the great
> military states shrinks before the absolute incalculability of its
> final outcome?

> All the more is it our duty to make again accessible to the German
> workers these brilliant proofs, now half-forgotten, of the
> far-sightedness of the international working class policy in 1870.

> What is true of these two Addresses is also true of *The Civil War in
> France*. On May 28, the last fighters of the Commune succumbed to
> superior forces on the slopes of Belleville; and only two days later,
> on May 30, Marx read to the General Council the work in which the
> historical significance of the Paris Commune is delineated in short
> powerful strokes, but with such clearness, and above all such truth,
> as has never again been attained on all the mass of literature which
> has been written on this subject.

> If today, we look back at the activity and historical significance of
> the Paris Commune of 1871, we shall find it necessary to make a few
> additions to the account given in *The Civil War in France*.
>
> The members of the Commune were divided into a majority of the
> Blanquists, who had also been predominant in the Central Committee of
> the National Guard; and a minority, members of the International
> Working Men's Association, chiefly consisting of adherents of the
> Proudhon school of socialism. The great majority of the Blanquists at
> that time were socialist only by revolutionary and proletarian
> instinct; only a few had attained greater clarity on the essential
> principles, through Vaillant, who was familiar with German scientific
> socialism. It is therefore comprehensible that in the economic sphere
> much was left undone which, according to our view today, the Commune
> ought to have done. The hardest thing to understand is certainly the
> holy awe with which they remained standing respectfully outside the
> gates of the Bank of France. This was also a serious political
> mistake. The bank in the hands of the Commune -- this would have been
> worth more than 10,000 hostages. It would have meant the pressure of
> the whole of the French bourgeoisie on the Versailles government in
> favor of peace with the Commune, but what is still more wonderful is
> the correctness of so much that was actually done by the Commune,
> composed as it was of Blanquists and Proudhonists. Naturally, the
> Proudhonists were chiefly responsible for the economic decrees of the
> Commune, both for their praiseworthy and their unpraiseworthy aspects;
> as the Blanquists were for its political actions and omissions. And in
> both cases the irony of history willed -- as is usual when
> doctrinaires come to the helm -- that both did the opposite of what
> the doctrines of their school proscribed.
>
> Proudhon, the Socialist of the small peasant and master-craftsman,
> regarded association with positive hatred. He said of it that there
> was more bad than good in it; that it was by nature sterile, even
> harmful, because it was a fetter on the freedom of the workers; that
> it was a pure dogma, unproductive and burdensome, in conflict as much
> with the freedom of the workers as with economy of labor; that its
> disadvantages multiplied more swiftly than its advantages; that, as
> compared with it, competition, division of labor and private property
> were economic forces. Only for the exceptional cases -- as Proudhon
> called them -- of large-scale industry and large industrial units,
> such as railways, was there any place for the association of workers.
> *(Cf. Idee Generale de la Revolution, 3 etude.)*
>
> By 1871, even in Paris, the centre of handicrafts, large-scale
> industry had already so much ceased to be an exceptional case that by
> far the most important decree of the Commune instituted an
> organization of large-scale industry and even of manufacture which was
> not based only on the association of workers in each factory, but also
> aimed at combining all these associations in one great union; in short
> an organization which, as Marx quite rightly says in *The Civil War*,
> must necessarily have led in the end to communism, that is to say, the
> direct antithesis of the Proudhon doctrine. And, therefore, the
> Commune was also the grave of the Proudhon school of socialism. Today
> this school has vanished from French working class circles; among them
> now, among the
> [Possibilists](../../../../../glossary/orgs/p/o.htm#possibilists) no
> less than among the "Marxists", Marx's theory rules unchallenged. Only
> among the "radical" bourgeoisie are there still Proudhonists.
>
> The Blanquists fared no better. Brought up in the school of
> conspiracy, and held together by the strict discipline which went with
> it, they started out from the viewpoint that a relatively small number
> of resolute, well-organized men would be able, at a given favorable
> moment, not only seize the helm of state, but also by energetic and
> relentless action, to keep power until they succeeded in drawing the
> mass of the people into the revolution and ranging them round the
> small band of leaders. this conception involved, above all, the
> strictest dictatorship and centralization of all power in the hands of
> the new revolutionary government. And what did the Commune, with its
> majority of these same Blanquists, actually do? In all its
> proclamations to the French in the provinces, it appealed to them to
> form a free federation of all French Communes with Paris, a national
> organization, which for the first time was really to be created by the
> nation itself. It was precisely the oppressing power of the former
> centralized government, army, political police and bureaucracy, which
> Napoleon had created in 1798 and since then had been taken over by
> every new government as a welcome instrument and used against its
> opponents, it was precisely this power which was to fall everywhere,
> just as it had already fallen in Paris.
>
> From the outset the Commune was compelled to recognize that the
> working class, once come to power, could not manage with the old state
> machine; that in order not to lose again its only just conquered
> supremacy, this working class must, on the one hand, do away with all
> the old repressive machinery previously used against it itself, and,
> on the other, safeguard itself against its own deputies and officials,
> by declaring them all, without exception, subject to recall at any
> moment. What had been the characteristic attribute of the former
> state? Society had created its own organs to look after its common
> interests, originally through simple division of labor. But these
> organs, at whose head was the state power, had in the course of time,
> in pursuance of their own special interests, transformed themselves
> from the servants of society into the masters of society, as can be
> seen, for example, not only in the hereditary monarchy, but equally
> also in the democratic republic. Nowhere do "politicians" form a more
> separate, powerful section of the nation than in North America. There,
> each of the two great parties which alternately succeed each other in
> power is itself in turn controlled by people who make a business of
> politics, who speculate on seats in the legislative assemblies of the
> Union as well as of the separate states, or who make a living by
> carrying on agitation for their party and on its victory are rewarded
> with positions.
>
> It is well known that the Americans have been striving for 30 years to
> shake off this yoke, which has become intolerable, and that in spite
> of all they can do they continue to sink ever deeper in this swamp of
> corruption. It is precisely in America that we see best how there
> takes place this process of the state power making itself independent
> in relation to society, whose mere instrument it was originally
> intended to be. Here there exists no dynasty, no nobility, no standing
> army, beyond the few men keeping watch on the Indians, no bureaucracy
> with permanent posts or the right to pensions. and nevertheless we
> find here two great gangs of political speculators, who alternately
> take possession of the state power and exploit it by the most corrupt
> means and for the most corrupt ends -- and the nation is powerless
> against these two great cartels of politicians, who are ostensibly its
> servants, but in reality exploit and plunder it.
>
> Against this transformation of the state and the organs of the state
> from servants of society into masters of society -- an inevitable
> transformation in all previous states -- the Commune made use of two
> infallible expedients. In this first place, it filled all posts --
> administrative, judicial, and educational -- by election on the basis
> of universal suffrage of all concerned, with the right of the same
> electors to recall their delegate at any time. And in the second
> place, all officials, high or low, were paid only the wages received
> by other workers. The highest salary paid by the Commune to anyone was
> 6,000 francs. In this way an effective barrier to place-hunting and
> careerism was set up, even apart from the binding mandates to
> delegates to representative bodies which were also added in profusion.
>
> This shattering of the former state power and its replacement by a new
> and really democratic state is described in detail in the third
> section of *The Civil War*. But it was necessary to dwell briefly here
> once more on some of its features, because in Germany particularly the
> superstitious belief in the state has been carried over from
> philosophy into the general consciousness of the bourgeoisie and even
> to many workers. According to the philosophical notion, "the state is
> the realization of the idea" or the Kingdom of God on earth,
> translated into philosophical terms, the sphere in which eternal truth
> and justice is or should be realized. And from this follows a
> superstitious reverence for the state and everything connected with
> it, which takes roots the more readily as people from their childhood
> are accustomed to imagine that the affairs and interests common to the
> whole of society could not be looked after otherwise than as they have
> been looked after in the past, that is, through the state and its
> well-paid officials. And people think they have taken quite an
> extraordinary bold step forward when they have rid themselves of
> belief in hereditary monarchy and swear by the democratic republic.
> []{#state-oppression}In reality, however, the state is nothing but a
> machine for the oppression of one class by another, and indeed in the
> democratic republic no less than in the monarchy; and at best an evil
> inherited by the proletariat after its victorious struggle for class
> supremacy, whose worst sides the proletariat, just like the Commune,
> cannot avoid having to lop off at the earliest possible moment, until
> such time as a new generation, reared in new and free social
> conditions, will be able to throw the entire lumber of the state on
> the scrap-heap.
>
> Of late, the Social-Democratic philistine has once more been filled
> with wholesome terror at the words: Dictatorship of the Proletariat.
> Well and good, gentlemen, do you want to know what this dictatorship
> looks like? Look at the Paris Commune. That was the Dictatorship of
> the Proletariat.
