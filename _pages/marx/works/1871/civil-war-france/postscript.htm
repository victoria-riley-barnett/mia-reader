  <h2>1891 Introduction by Frederick Engels<br>
  On the 20th Anniversary of the Paris Commune </h2>

  <h3>[PostScript]<sup class="ednote"><a href="#A" name="Ab">[A]</a></sup> </h3>
  <hr class="end">

  <p class="skip"> </p>

  <p>I did not anticipate that I would be asked to prepare a new edition of the
  Address of the General Council of the International on <em>The Civil War in
  France</em>, and to write an introduction to it. Therefore I can only touch
  briefly here on the most important points. </p>

  <p>I am prefacing the longer work mentioned above by the two shorter
  addresses of the General Council on the Franco-Prussian War. <span
  class="inote">[<a href="ch01.htm">Chapter 1</a> and <a
  href="ch02.htm">Chapter 2</a>]</span> In the first place, because the second
  of these, which itself cannot be fully understood without the first, is
  referred to in <em>The Civil War</em>. But also because these two Addresses,
  likewise drafted by Marx, are, no less than <em>The Civil War</em>,
  outstanding examples of the author&rsquo;s remarkable gift, first proved in
  <a href="../../1852/18th-brumaire/index.htm">The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis
  Bonaparte</a>, for grasping clearly the character, the import, and the
  necessary consequences of great historical events, at a time when these
  events are still in process before our eyes, or have only just taken place.
  And, finally, because we in Germany are still having to endure the
  consequences which Marx prophesied would follow from these events. </p>

  <p>Has that which was declared in the first Address not come to pass: that if
  Germany&rsquo;s defensive war against Louis Bonaparte degenerated into a war
  of conquest against the French people, all the misfortunes which befell
  Germany after the so-called wars of liberation<sup class="ednote"><a
  href="#B" name="Bb">[B]</a></sup> would revive again with renewed intensity?
  Have we not had a further 20 years of Bismarck&rsquo;s government, the <a
  href="../../../../../glossary/events/a/n.htm#anti-socialist-law">Exceptional
  Law</a> and the anti-socialist campaign taking the place of the prosecutions
  of demagogues,<sup class="ednote"><a href="#C" name="Cb">[C]</a></sup> with
  the same arbitrary police measures and with literally the same staggering
  interpretations of the law? </p>

  <p>And has not <a href="ch02.htm#Db">the prophecy</a> been proved to the
  letter that the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine would "force France into the
  arms of Russia," and that after this annexation Germany must either become
  the avowed tool of Russia, or must, after some short respite, arm for a new
  war, and, moreover, "a race war against the combined Slavonic and Roman
  races"? Has not the annexation of the French provinces driven France into the
  arms of Russia? Has not Bismarck for fully 20 years vainly wooed the favor of
  the tsar, wooed it with services even more lowly than those which little
  Prussia, before it became the "first power in Europe," was wont to lay at
  Holy Russia&rsquo;s feet? And is there not every day hanging over our heads
  the Damocles&rsquo; sword of war, on the first day of which all the chartered
  covenants of princes will be scattered like chaff; a war of which nothing is
  certain but the absolute uncertainty of its outcome; a race war which will
  subject the whole of Europe to devastation by 15 or 20 million armed men, and
  is only not already raging because even the strongest of the great military
  states shrinks before the absolute incalculability of its final outcome? </p>

  <p>All the more is it our duty to make again accessible to the German workers
  these brilliant proofs, now half-forgotten, of the far-sightedness of the
  international working class policy in 1870. </p>

  <p>What is true of these two Addresses is also true of <em>The Civil War in
  France</em>. On May 28, the last fighters of the Commune succumbed to
  superior forces on the slopes of Belleville; and only two days later, on May
  30, Marx read to the General Council the work in which the historical
  significance of the Paris Commune is delineated in short powerful strokes,
  but with such clearness, and above all such truth, as has never again been
  attained on all the mass of literature which has been written on this
  subject. </p>
  <hr class="section">

  <p>If today, we look back at the activity and historical significance of the
  Paris Commune of 1871, we shall find it necessary to make a few additions to
  the account given in <em>The Civil War in France</em>. </p>

  <p>The members of the Commune were divided into a majority of the Blanquists,
  who had also been predominant in the Central Committee of the National Guard;
  and a minority, members of the International Working Men&rsquo;s Association,
  chiefly consisting of adherents of the Proudhon school of socialism. The
  great majority of the Blanquists at that time were socialist only by
  revolutionary and proletarian instinct; only a few had attained greater
  clarity on the essential principles, through Vaillant, who was familiar with
  German scientific socialism. It is therefore comprehensible that in the
  economic sphere much was left undone which, according to our view today, the
  Commune ought to have done. The hardest thing to understand is certainly the
  holy awe with which they remained standing respectfully outside the gates of
  the Bank of France. This was also a serious political mistake. The bank in
  the hands of the Commune &ndash; this would have been worth more than 10,000
  hostages. It would have meant the pressure of the whole of the French
  bourgeoisie on the Versailles government in favor of peace with the Commune,
  but what is still more wonderful is the correctness of so much that was
  actually done by the Commune, composed as it was of Blanquists and
  Proudhonists. Naturally, the Proudhonists were chiefly responsible for the
  economic decrees of the Commune, both for their praiseworthy and their
  unpraiseworthy aspects; as the Blanquists were for its political actions and
  omissions. And in both cases the irony of history willed &ndash; as is usual
  when doctrinaires come to the helm &ndash; that both did the opposite of what
  the doctrines of their school proscribed. </p>

  <p>Proudhon, the Socialist of the small peasant and master-craftsman,
  regarded association with positive hatred. He said of it that there was more
  bad than good in it; that it was by nature sterile, even harmful, because it
  was a fetter on the freedom of the workers; that it was a pure dogma,
  unproductive and burdensome, in conflict as much with the freedom of the
  workers as with economy of labor; that its disadvantages multiplied more
  swiftly than its advantages; that, as compared with it, competition, division
  of labor and private property were economic forces. Only for the exceptional
  cases &ndash; as Proudhon called them &ndash; of large-scale industry and
  large industrial units, such as railways, was there any place for the
  association of workers. <em>(Cf. Idee Generale de la Revolution, 3
  etude.)</em> </p>

  <p>By 1871, even in Paris, the centre of handicrafts, large-scale industry
  had already so much ceased to be an exceptional case that by far the most
  important decree of the Commune instituted an organization of large-scale
  industry and even of manufacture which was not based only on the association
  of workers in each factory, but also aimed at combining all these
  associations in one great union; in short an organization which, as Marx
  quite rightly says in <em>The Civil War</em>, must necessarily have led in
  the end to communism, that is to say, the direct antithesis of the Proudhon
  doctrine. And, therefore, the Commune was also the grave of the Proudhon
  school of socialism. Today this school has vanished from French working class
  circles; among them now, among the <a
  href="../../../../../glossary/orgs/p/o.htm#possibilists">Possibilists</a> no
  less than among the &ldquo;Marxists&rdquo;, Marx&rsquo;s theory rules
  unchallenged. Only among the &ldquo;radical&rdquo; bourgeoisie are there
  still Proudhonists. </p>

  <p>The Blanquists fared no better. Brought up in the school of conspiracy,
  and held together by the strict discipline which went with it, they started
  out from the viewpoint that a relatively small number of resolute,
  well-organized men would be able, at a given favorable moment, not only seize
  the helm of state, but also by energetic and relentless action, to keep power
  until they succeeded in drawing the mass of the people into the revolution
  and ranging them round the small band of leaders. this conception involved,
  above all, the strictest dictatorship and centralization of all power in the
  hands of the new revolutionary government. And what did the Commune, with its
  majority of these same Blanquists, actually do? In all its proclamations to
  the French in the provinces, it appealed to them to form a free federation of
  all French Communes with Paris, a national organization, which for the first
  time was really to be created by the nation itself. It was precisely the
  oppressing power of the former centralized government, army, political police
  and bureaucracy, which Napoleon had created in 1798 and since then had been
  taken over by every new government as a welcome instrument and used against
  its opponents, it was precisely this power which was to fall everywhere, just
  as it had already fallen in Paris. </p>

  <p>From the outset the Commune was compelled to recognize that the working
  class, once come to power, could not manage with the old state machine; that
  in order not to lose again its only just conquered supremacy, this working
  class must, on the one hand, do away with all the old repressive machinery
  previously used against it itself, and, on the other, safeguard itself
  against its own deputies and officials, by declaring them all, without
  exception, subject to recall at any moment. What had been the characteristic
  attribute of the former state? Society had created its own organs to look
  after its common interests, originally through simple division of labor. But
  these organs, at whose head was the state power, had in the course of time,
  in pursuance of their own special interests, transformed themselves from the
  servants of society into the masters of society, as can be seen, for example,
  not only in the hereditary monarchy, but equally also in the democratic
  republic. Nowhere do &ldquo;politicians&rdquo; form a more separate, powerful
  section of the nation than in North America. There, each of the two great
  parties which alternately succeed each other in power is itself in turn
  controlled by people who make a business of politics, who speculate on seats
  in the legislative assemblies of the Union as well as of the separate states,
  or who make a living by carrying on agitation for their party and on its
  victory are rewarded with positions. </p>

  <p>It is well known that the Americans have been striving for 30 years to
  shake off this yoke, which has become intolerable, and that in spite of all
  they can do they continue to sink ever deeper in this swamp of corruption. It
  is precisely in America that we see best how there takes place this process
  of the state power making itself independent in relation to society, whose
  mere instrument it was originally intended to be. Here there exists no
  dynasty, no nobility, no standing army, beyond the few men keeping watch on
  the Indians, no bureaucracy with permanent posts or the right to pensions.
  and nevertheless we find here two great gangs of political speculators, who
  alternately take possession of the state power and exploit it by the most
  corrupt means and for the most corrupt ends &ndash; and the nation is
  powerless against these two great cartels of politicians, who are ostensibly
  its servants, but in reality exploit and plunder it. </p>

  <p>Against this transformation of the state and the organs of the state from
  servants of society into masters of society &ndash; an inevitable
  transformation in all previous states &ndash; the Commune made use of two
  infallible expedients. In this first place, it filled all posts &ndash;
  administrative, judicial, and educational &ndash; by election on the basis of
  universal suffrage of all concerned, with the right of the same electors to
  recall their delegate at any time. And in the second place, all officials,
  high or low, were paid only the wages received by other workers. The highest
  salary paid by the Commune to anyone was 6,000 francs. In this way an
  effective barrier to place-hunting and careerism was set up, even apart from
  the binding mandates to delegates to representative bodies which were also
  added in profusion. </p>

  <p>This shattering of the former state power and its replacement by a new and
  really democratic state is described in detail in the third section of
  <em>The Civil War</em>. But it was necessary to dwell briefly here once more
  on some of its features, because in Germany particularly the superstitious
  belief in the state has been carried over from philosophy into the general
  consciousness of the bourgeoisie and even to many workers. According to the
  philosophical notion, &ldquo;the state is the realization of the idea&rdquo; or the
  Kingdom of God on earth, translated into philosophical terms, the sphere in
  which eternal truth and justice is or should be realized. And from this
  follows a superstitious reverence for the state and everything connected with
  it, which takes roots the more readily as people from their childhood are
  accustomed to imagine that the affairs and interests common to the whole of
  society could not be looked after otherwise than as they have been looked
  after in the past, that is, through the state and its well-paid officials.
  And people think they have taken quite an extraordinary bold step forward
  when they have rid themselves of belief in hereditary monarchy and swear by
  the democratic republic. <a name="state-oppression"></a>In reality, however,
  the state is nothing but a machine for the oppression of one class by
  another, and indeed in the democratic republic no less than in the monarchy;
  and at best an evil inherited by the proletariat after its victorious
  struggle for class supremacy, whose worst sides the proletariat, just like
  the Commune, cannot avoid having to lop off at the earliest possible moment,
  until such time as a new generation, reared in new and free social
  conditions, will be able to throw the entire lumber of the state on the
  scrap-heap. </p>

  <p>Of late, the Social-Democratic philistine has once more been filled with
  wholesome terror at the words: Dictatorship of the Proletariat. Well and
  good, gentlemen, do you want to know what this dictatorship looks like? Look
  at the Paris Commune. That was the Dictatorship of the Proletariat. </p>
