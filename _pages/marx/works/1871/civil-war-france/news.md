> "The column of prisoners halted in the Avenue Uhrich, and was drawn
> up, four or five deep, on the footway facing to the road. General
> Marquis de Gallifet and his staff dismounted and commenced an
> inspection from the left of the line. Walking down slowly and eyeing
> the ranks, the general stopped here and there, tapping a man on the
> shoulder or beckoning him out of the rear ranks. In most cases,
> without further parley, the individual thus selected was marched out
> into the centre of the road, where a small supplementary column was
> thus soon formed\.... A mounted officer pointed out to General
> Gallifet a man and woman for some particular offence. The women,
> rushing out of the ranks, threw herself on her knees, and, with
> outstretched arms, protested her innocence in passionate terms. The
> general waited for a pause, and then with most impassible face and
> unmoved demeanor, said: 'Madame, I have visited every theatre in
> Paris, your acting will have no effect on me.' (ce n'est pas la peine
> de jouer la comedie)\.... It was not a good thing on that day to be
> noticeably taller, dirtier, cleaner, older, uglier than one's
> neighbors. One individual in particular struck me as probably owing
> his speedy release from the ills of this world to his having a broken
> nose\.... Over a hundred being thus chosen, a firing party told off,
> and the column resumed its march, leaving them behind. A few minutes
> afterwards a dropping fire in our rear commenced, and continued for
> over a quarter of an hour. It was the execution of the
> summarily-convicted wretches." (Paris Correspondent, *Daily News*,

> Jacques-la-Bouchiere; some of them very superficially. In the daytime
> the roar of the busy streets prevented any notice being taken; but in
> the stillness of the night the inhabitants of the houses in the
> neighborhood were roused by distant moans, and in the morning a
> clenched hand was seen protruding through the soil. In consequence of
> this, exhumations were ordered to take place\.... that many wounded
> have been buried alive I have not the slightest doubt. One case I can
> vouch for. When Brunel was shot with his mistress on the 24th ult. in
> the courtyard of a house in the place Vendome, the bodies lay there
> until the afternoon of the 27th. When the burial party came to remove
> the corpses, they found the woman still living, and took her to an
> ambulance. Though she had received four bullets she is now out of
> danger." (Paris Correspondent, *Evening Standard*, June 8.)

> "To the editor of *The Times*:
>
> "Sir. -- On June 6, 1871, M. Jules Favre issued a circular to all the
> European Powers, calling them to hunt down the International Working
> Men's Association. A few remarks will suffice to characterize that
> document.
>
> "In the very preamble to our statutes it is stated that the
> International was found "September 28, 1864, at a public meeting held
> at St. Martin's Hall, Long Acre, London\". For purposes of his own
> Jules Favre puts back the date of its origin behind 1862.
>
> "In order to explain our principles, he professes to quote "their (the
> International's) sheet of the 25th of March, 1869\". And then what
> does he quote? The sheet of a society which is not the International.
> This sort of maneuvre he already recurred to when, still a
> comparatively young lawyer, he had to defend the *National* newspaper,
> prosecuted for libel by Cabet. Then he pretended to read extracts from
> Cabet's pamphlets while reading interpolations of his own -- a trick
> exposed while the court was sitting, and which, but for the indulgence
> of Cabet, would have been punished by Jules Favre's expulsion for the
> Paris bar. Of all the documents quoted by him as documents of the
> International, not one belongs to the International.
>
> He says, for instance,
>
> "The Alliance declared itself Atheist, says the General Council,
> constituted in London in July 1869."
>
> "The General Council never issued such a document. On the contrary, it
> issued a document which quashed the original statutes of the
> 'Alliance' -- L'Alliance de la Démocratie Socialiste at Geneva --
> quoted by Jules favre.
>
> "Throughout his circular, which pretends in part also to be directed
> against the Empire, Jules Favre repeats against the International but
> the police inventions of the public prosecutors of the Empire, which
> broke down miserably even before the laws courts of that Empire.
>
> "It is known that in its two Addresses (of [July](ch01.htm) and
> [September](ch02.htm) last) on the late war, the General Council of
> the International denounced the Prussian plans of conquest against
> France. Later on, Mr. Reitlinger, Jules Favre's private secretary,
> applied, though of course in vain, to some members of the General
> Council for getting up by the Council a demonstration against
> Bismarck, in favor of the Government of National Defence; they were
> particularly requested not to mention the republic. The preparations
> for a demonstration with regard to the expected arrival of Jules Favre
> in London were made -- certainly with the best of intentions -- in
> spite of the General Council, which, in its address of the 9th of
> September, had distinctly forewarned the Paris workmen against Jules
> Favre and his colleagues.
>
> "What would Jules Favre say if, in its turn, the International were to
> send a circular on Jules Favre to all the Cabinets of Europe, drawing
> their particular attention to the document published at Paris by the
> late M. Milliere?

> In an article on "The International Society and its aims," that pious
> informer, the *London Spectator* (June 24th), amongst other similar
> tricks, quotes, *even more* fully than Jules Favre has done, the above
> document of the "Alliance" as the work of the International, and that
> *eleven days* after the refutation had been published in *The Times.*
> We do not wonder at this. Frederick the Great used to say that of all
