  <h2>The Third Address<br>
  May, 1871 </h2>

  <h3>[The Fall of Paris] </h3>
  <hr class="end">

  <p class="skip"> </p>

  <p>The first attempt of the slaveholders&rsquo; conspiracy to put down Paris
  by getting the Prussians to occupy it was frustrated by Bismarck&rsquo;s
  refusal. </p>

  <p>The second attempt, that of March 18, ended in the rout of the army and
  the flight to Versailles of the government, which ordered the whole
  administration to break up and follow in its track. </p>

  <p>By the semblance of peace negotiations with Paris, Thiers found the time
  to prepare for war against it. But where to find an army? The remnants of the
  line regiments were weak in number and unsafe in character. His urgent appeal
  to the provinces to succour Versailles, by their National Guards and
  volunteers, met with a flat refusal. Brittany alone furnished a handful of
  <em>Chouans</em><sup class="ednote"><a href="#A" name="Ab">[A]</a></sup>
  fighting under a white flag, every one of them wearing on his breast the
  heart of Jesus in white cloth, and shouting &ldquo;Vive le Roi!&rdquo; (Long
  live the King!) </p>

  <p>Thiers was, therefore, compelled to collect, in hot haste, a motley crew,
  composed of sailors, marines, Pontifical Zouaves, Valentin&rsquo;s gendarmes,
  and Pietri&rsquo;s <em>sergents-de-ville</em> and <em>mouchards</em>. This
  army, however, would have been ridiculously ineffective without the
  instalments of imperialist war prisoners, which Bismarck granted in numbers
  just sufficient to keep the civil war a-going, and keep the Versailles
  government in abject dependence on Prussia. During the war itself, the
  Versailles police had to look after the Versailles army, while the gendarmes
  had to drag it on by exposing themselves at all posts of danger. The forts
  which fell were not taken, but bought. The heroism of the Federals convinced
  Thiers that the resistance of Paris was not to be broken by his own strategic
  genius and the bayonets at his disposal. </p>

  <p>Meanwhile, his relations with the provinces became more and more
  difficult. Not one single address of approval came in to gladden Thiers and
  his Rurals. Quite the contrary. Deputations and addresses demanding, in a
  tone anything but respectful, conciliation with Paris on the basis of the
  unequivocal recognition of the republic, the acknowledgment of the Communal
  liberties, and the dissolution of the National Assembly, whose mandate was
  extinct, poured in from all sides, and in such numbers that Dufaure,
  Thiers&rsquo; Minister of Justice, in his circular of April 23 to the public
  prosecutors, commanded them to treat &ldquo;the cry of conciliation&rdquo; as
  a crime! In regard, however, of the hopeless prospect held out by his
  campaign, Thiers resolved to shift his tactics by ordering, all over the
  country, municipal elections to take place on April 30, on the basis of the
  new municipal law dictated by himself to the National Assembly. What with the
  intrigues of his prefects, what with police intimidation, he felt quite
  sanguine of imparting, by the verdict of the provinces, to the National
  Assembly that moral power it had never possessed, and of getting at last from
  the provinces the physical force required for the conquest of Paris. </p>

  <p>His bandit-warfare against Paris, exalted in his own bulletins, and the
  attempts of his ministers at the establishment, throughout France, of a reign
  of terror, Thiers was from the beginning anxious to accompany with a little
  by-play of conciliation, which had to serve more than one purpose. It was to
  dupe the provinces, to inveigle the middle class elements in Paris, and above
  all, to afford the professed republicans in the National Assembly the
  opportunity of hiding their treason against Paris behind their faith in
  Thiers. </p>

  <p>On March 21, when still without an army, he had declared to the Assembly:
  &ldquo;Come what may, I will not send an army to Paris.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>On March 27, he rose again: &ldquo;I have found the republic an
  accomplished fact, and I am firmly resolved to maintain it.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>In reality, he put down the revolution at Lyons and Marseilles<sup
  class="ednote"><a href="#B" name="Bb">[B]</a></sup> in the name of the
  republic, while the roars of his Rurals drowned the very mention of his name
  at Versailles. After this exploit, he toned down the &ldquo;accomplished
  fact&rdquo; into a hypothetical fact. The Orleans princes, whom he had
  cautiously warned off Bordeaux, were now, in flagrant breach of the law,
  permitted to intrigue at Dreux. The concessions held out by Thiers in his
  interminable interviews with the delegates from Paris and the provinces,
  although constantly varied in tone and color, according to time and
  circumstances, did in fact never come to more than the prospective
  restriction of revenge to the &ldquo;handful of criminals implicated in the
  murder of Lecomte and Clement Thomas,&rdquo; on the well-understood premise
  that Paris and France were unreservedly to accept M. Thiers himself as the
  best of possible Republics, as he, in 1830, had done with Louis Philippe, and
  in 1849 under Louis Bonaparte&rsquo;s presidency. While out of office, he
  made a fortune by pleading for the Paris capitalists, and made political
  capital by pleading against the laws he had himself originated. He now
  hurried through the National Assembly not only a set of repressive laws which
  were, after the fall of Paris, to extirpate the last remnants of republican
  liberty in France; he foreshadowed the fate of Paris by abridging what was
  for him the too slow procedure of courts-martial,<sup class="ednote"><a
  href="#C" name="Cb">[C]</a></sup> and by a new-fangled, Draconic code of
  deportation. The Revolution of 1848, abolishing the penalty of death for
  political crimes, had replaced it by deportation. Louis Bonaparte did not
  dare, at least not in theory, to re-establish the regime of the guillotine.
  The Rural Assembly, not yet bold enough even to hint that the Parisians were
  not rebels, but assassins, had therefore to confine its prospective vengeance
  against Paris to Dufaure&rsquo;s new code of deportation. Under all these
  circumstances, Thiers himself could not have gone on with his comedy of
  conciliation, had it not, as he intended it to do, drawn forth shrieks of
  rage from the Rurals, whose ruminating mind did neither understand the play,
  nor its necessities of hypocrisy, tergiversation, and procrastination. </p>

  <p>In sight of the impending municipal elections of April 30, Thiers enacted
  one of his great conciliation scenes on April 27. Amidst a flood of sentiment
  rhetoric, he exclaimed from the tribune of the Assembly: </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;There exists no conspiracy against the republic but
  that of Paris, which compels us to shed French blood. I repeat it again and
  again. Let those impious arms fall from the hands which hold them, and
  chastisement will be arrested at once by an act of peace excluding only the
  small number of criminals.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>To the violent interruption of the Rurals, he replied: </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Gentlemen, tell me, I implore you, am I wrong? Do
  you really regret that I could have stated the truth that the criminals are
  only a handful? Is it not fortunate in the midst of our misfortunes that
  those who have been capable to shed the blood of Clement Thomas and General
  Lecomte are but rare exceptions?&rdquo; </p>

  <p>France, however, turned a deaf ear to what Thiers flattered himself to be
  a parliamentary siren&rsquo;s song. Out of 700,000 municipal councillors
  returned by the 35,000 communes still left to France, the united Legitimists,
  Orleanists, and Bonapartists did not carry 8,000. </p>

  <p>The supplementary elections which followed were still more decidedly
  hostile. </p>

  <p>Thus, instead of getting from the provinces the badly-needed physical
  force, the National Assembly lost even its last claim to moral force, that of
  being the expression of the universal suffrage of the country. To complete
  the discomfiture, the newly-chosen municipal councils of all the cities of
  France openly threatened the usurping Assembly at Versailles with a counter
  assembly at Bordeaux. </p>

  <p>Then the long-expected moment of decisive action had at last come for
  Bismarck. He peremptorily summoned Thiers to send to Frankfort
  plenipotentiaries for the definitive settlement of peace. In humble obedience
  to the call of his master, Thiers hastened to despatch his trusty Jules
  Favre, backed by Pouyer-Quertier. Pouyer-Quertier, an &ldquo;eminent&rdquo;
  Rouen cotton-spinner, a fervent and even servile partisan of the Second
  Empire, had never found any fault with it save its commercial treaty with
  England,<sup class="ednote"><a href="#D" name="Db">[D]</a></sup> prejudicial
  to his own shop-interest. Hardly installed at Bordeaux as Thiers&rsquo;
  Minister of Finance, he denounced that &ldquo;unholy&rdquo; treaty, hinted at
  its near abrogation, and had even the effrontery to try, although in vain
  (having counted without Bismarck), the immediate enforcement of the old
  protective duties against Alsace, where, he said, no previous international
  treaties stood in the way. This man who considered counter-revolution as a
  means to put down wages at Rouen, and the surrender of French provinces as a
  means to bring up the price of his wares in France, was he not <em>the
  one</em> predestined to be picked out by Thiers as the helpmate of Jules
  Favre in his last and crowning treason? </p>

  <p>On the arrival at Frankfurt of this exquisite pair of plenipotentiaries,
  bully Bismarck at once met them with the imperious alternative: Either the
  restoration of the empire or the unconditional acceptance of my own peace
  terms! These terms included a shortening of the intervals in which war
  indemnity was to be paid and the continued occupation of the Paris forts by
  Prussian troops until Bismarck should feel satisfied with the state of things
  in France; Prussia thus being recognized as the supreme arbiter in internal
  French politics! In return for this, he offered to let loose for the
  extermination of Paris the Bonapartist army, and to lend them the direct
  assistance of Emperor William&rsquo;s troops. He pledged his good faith by
  making payment of the first installment of the indemnity dependent on the
  &ldquo;pacification&rdquo; of Paris. Such bait was, of course, eagerly
  swallowed by Thiers and his plenipotentiaries. They signed the treaty of
  peace on May 10 and had it endorsed by the Versailles Assembly on the 18th.
  </p>

  <p>In the interval between the conclusion of peace and the arrival of the
  Bonapartist prisoners, Thiers felt the more bound to resume his comedy of
  conciliation, as his republican tools stood in sore need of a pretext for
  blinking their eyes at the preparations for the carnage of Paris. As late as
  May 18, he replied to a deputation of middle-class conciliators &ndash; </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Whenever the insurgents will make up their minds for
  capitulation, the gates of Paris shall be flung wide open during a week for
  all except the murderers of Generals Clement Thomas and Lecomte.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>A few days afterwards, when violently interpellated on these promises by
  the Rurals, he refused to enter into any explanations; not, however, without
  giving them this significant hint: </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;I tell you there are impatient men amongst you, men
  who are in too great a hurry. They must have another eight days; at the end
  of these eight days there will be no more danger, and the task will be
  proportionate to their courage and to their capacities.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>As soon as MacMahon was able to assure him, that he could shortly enter
  Paris, Thiers declared to the Assembly that </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;he would enter Paris with the <em>laws</em> in his
  hands, and demand a full expiation from the wretches who had sacrificed the
  lives of soldiers and destroyed public monuments.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>As the moment of decision drew near, he said &ndash; to the Assembly,
  &ldquo;I shall be pitiless!&rdquo; &ndash; to Paris, that it was doomed; and
  to his Bonapartist bandits, that they had state licence to wreak vengeance
  upon Paris to their hearts&rsquo; content. </p>

  <p>At last, when treachery had opened the gates of Paris to General Douai, on
  May 21, Thiers, on the 22nd, revealed to the Rurals the &ldquo;goal&rdquo; of
  his conciliation comedy, which they had so obstinately persisted in not
  understanding. </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;I told you a few days ago that we were approaching
  <em>our goal</em>; today I come to tell you <em>the goal</em> is
  reached. The victory of order, justice, and civilization is at last
  won!&rdquo; </p>

  <p>So it was. The civilization and justice of bourgeois order comes out in
  its lurid light whenever the slaves and drudges of that order rise against
  their masters. Then this civilization and justice stand forth as undisguised
  savagery and lawless revenge. Each new crisis in the class struggle between
  the appropriator and the producer brings out this fact more glaringly. Even
  the atrocities of the bourgeois in June 1848 vanish before the infamy of
  1871. The self-sacrificing heroism with which the population of Paris &ndash;
  men, women, and children &ndash; fought for eight days after the entrance of
  the Versaillese, reflects as much the grandeur of their cause, as the
  infernal deeds of the soldiery reflect the innate spirit of that
  civilization, indeed, the great problem of which is how to get rid of the
  heaps of corpses it made after the battle was over! </p>

  <p>To find a parallel for the conduct of Thiers and his bloodhounds we must
  go back to the times of Sulla and the two Triumvirates of Rome.<sup
  class="ednote"><a href="#E" name="Eb">[E]</a></sup> The same wholesale
  slaughter in cold blood; the same disregard, in massacre, of age and sex, the
  same system of torturing prisoners; the same proscriptions, but this time of
  a whole class; the same savage hunt after concealed leaders, lest one might
  escape; the same denunciations of political and private enemies; the same
  indifference for the butchery of entire strangers to the feud. </p>

  <p>There is but this difference: that the Romans had no
  <em>mitrailleuses</em> for the despatch, in the lump, of the proscribed, and
  that they had not &ldquo;the law in their hands,&rdquo; nor on their lips the
  cry of &ldquo;civilization.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>And after those horrors look upon the other still more hideous face of the
  bourgeois civilization as described by its own press! </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;With stray shots,&rdquo; writes the Paris
  correspondent of a London Tory paper, &ldquo;still ringing in the distance,
  and unintended wounded wretches dying amid the tombstones of Pere la Chaise
  &ndash; with 6,000 terror-stricken insurgents wandering in an agony of
  despair in the labyrinth of the catacombs, and wretches hurried through the
  streets to be shot down in scores by the <em>mitrailleuse</em> &ndash; it is
  revolting to see the cafes filled with the votaries of absinthe, billiards,
  and dominoes; female profligacy perambulating the boulevards, and the sound
  of revelry disturbing the night from the <em>cabinets particuliers</em> of
  fashionable restaurants.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>M. Edouard Herve writes in the <em>Journal de Paris</em>, a Versaillist
  journal pressed by the Commune: </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The way in which the population of Paris [!]
  manifested its satisfaction yesterday was rather more than frivolous, and we
  fear it will grow worse as time progresses. Paris has now a <em>fete</em> day
  appearance, which is sadly out of place; and, unless we are to be called the
  <em>Parisiens de la decadence</em>, this sort of thing must come to an
  end.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>And then he quotes the passage from Tacitus: </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Yet, on the morrow of that horrible struggle, even
  before it was completely over, Rome &ndash; degraded and corrupt &ndash;
  began once more to wallow in the voluptuous slough which was destroying its
  body and pulling its soul &ndash; <em>alibi proelia et vulnera, alibi balnea
  popinoeque</em> [here fights and wounds, there baths and restaurants].&rdquo;
  </p>

  <p>M. Herve only forgets to say that the &ldquo;population of Paris&rdquo; he
  speaks of is but the population of the Paris of M. Thiers &ndash; the
  <em>francs-fileurs</em> returning in throngs from Versailles, Saint-Denis,
  Rueil, and Saint Germain &ndash; the Paris of the &ldquo;Decline.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>In all its bloody triumphs over the self-sacrificing champions of a new
  and better society, that nefarious civilization, based upon the enslavement
  of labor, drowns the moans of its victims in a hue-and-cry of calumny,
  reverberated by a world-wide echo. The serene working men&rsquo;s Paris of
  the Commune is suddenly changed into a pandemonium by the bloodhounds of
  &ldquo;order.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>And what does this tremendous change prove to the bourgeois mind of all
  countries? Why, that the Commune has conspired against civilization! The
  Paris people die enthusiastically for the Commune in numbers unequally in any
  battle known to history. What does that prove? Why, that the Commune was not
  the people&rsquo;s own government but the usurpation of a handful of
  criminals! The women of Paris joyfully give up their lives at the barricades
  and on the place of execution. What does this prove? Why, that the demon of
  the Commune has changed them into Megaera and Hecates! </p>

  <p>The moderation of the Commune during the two months of undisputed sway is
  equalled only by the heroism of its defence. </p>

  <p>What does that prove? Why, that for months the Commune carefully hid,
  under a mask of moderation and humanity, the bloodthirstiness of its fiendish
  instincts to be let loose in the hour of its agony<a name="art">!</a> </p>

  <p>The working men&rsquo;s Paris, in the act of its heroic self-holocaust,
  involved in its flames buildings and monuments. While tearing to pieces the
  living body of the proletariat, its rulers must no longer expect to return
  triumphantly into the intact architecture of their abodes. The government of
  Versailles cries, &ldquo;Incendiarism!&rdquo; and whispers this cue to all
  its agents, down to the remotest hamlet, to hunt up its enemies everywhere as
  suspect of professional incendiarism. The bourgeoisie of the whole world,
  which looks complacently upon the wholesale massacre after the battle, is
  convulsed by horror at the desecration of brick and mortar! </p>

  <p>When governments give state licences to their navies to &ldquo;kill,
  <em>burn</em>, and destroy,&rdquo; is that licence for incendiarism? When the
  British troops wantonly set fire to the Capitol at Washington and to the
  summer palace of the Chinese emperor,<sup class="ednote"><a href="#F"
  name="Fb">[F]</a></sup> was that incendiarism? When the Prussians not for
  military reasons, but out of the mere spite of revenge, burned down, by the
  help of petroleum, towns like Chateaudun and innumerable villages, was that
  incendiarism? When Thiers, during six weeks, bombarded Paris, under the
  pretext that he wanted to set fire to those houses only in which there were
  people, was that incendiarism? &ndash; In war, fire is an arm as legitimate
  as any. Buildings held by the enemy are shelled to set them on fire. If their
  defenders have to retire, they themselves light the flames to prevent the
  attack from making use of the buildings. To be burned down has always been
  the inevitable fate of all buildings situated in the front of battle of all
  the regular armies of the world. </p>

  <p>But in the war of the enslaved against their enslavers, the only
  justifiable war in history, this is by no means to hold good! The Commune
  used fire strictly as a means of defence. They used it to stop up to the
  Versailles troops those long, straight avenues which Haussman had expressly
  opened to artillery-fire; they used it to cover their retreat, in the same
  way as the Versaillese, in their advance, used their shells which destroyed
  at least as many buildings as the fire of the Commune. It is a matter of
  dispute, even now, which buildings were set fire to by the defence, and which
  by the attack. And the defence resorted to fire only then when the Versailles
  troops had already commenced their wholesale murdering of prisoners. </p>

  <p>Besides, the Commune had, long before, given full public notice that if
  driven to extremities, they would bury themselves under the ruins of Paris,
  and make Paris a second Moscow, as the Government of National Defence, but
  only as a cloak for its treason, had promised to do. For this purpose Trochu
  had found them the petroleum. The Commune knew that its opponents cared
  nothing for the lives of the Paris people, but cared much for their own Paris
  buildings. And Thiers, on the other hand, had given them notice that he would
  be implacable in his vengeance. No sooner had he got his army ready on one
  side, and the Prussians shutting the trap on the other, than he proclaimed:
  &ldquo;I shall be pitiless! The expiation will be complete, and justice will
  be stern!&rdquo; If the acts of the Paris working men were vandalism, it was
  the vandalism of defence in despair, not the vandalism of triumph, like that
  which the Christians perpetrated upon the really priceless art treasures of
  heathen antiquity; and even that vandalism has been justified by the
  historian as an unavoidable and comparatively trifling concomitant to the
  titanic struggle between a new society arising and an old one breaking down.
  It was still less the vandalism of Haussman, razing historic Paris to make
  place for the Paris of the sightseer! </p>

  <p>But the execution by the Commune of the 64 hostages, with the Archbishop
  of Paris at their head! The bourgeoisie and its army, in June 1848,
  re-established a custom which had long disappeared from the practice of war
  &ndash; the shooting of their defenceless prisoners. This brutal custom has
  since been more or less strictly adhered to by the suppressors of all popular
  commotions in Europe and India; thus proving that it constitutes a real
  &ldquo;progress of civilization&rdquo;! </p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Prussians in France, had re-established the
  practice of taking hostages &ndash; innocent men, who, with their lives, were
  to answer to them for the acts of others. When Thiers, as we have seen, from
  the very beginning of the conflict, enforced the human practice of shooting
  down the Communal prisoners, the Commune, to protect their lives, was obliged
  to resort to the Prussian practice of securing hostages. The lives of the
  hostages have been forfeited over and over again by the continued shooting of
  prisoners on the part of the Versaillese. How could they be spared any longer
  after the carnage with which MacMahon&rsquo;s praetorians<sup
  class="ednote"><a href="#G" name="Gb">[G]</a></sup> celebrated their entrance
  into Paris? </p>

  <p>Was even the last check upon the unscrupulous ferocity of bourgeois
  governments &ndash; the taking of hostages &ndash; to be made a mere sham of?
  </p>

  <p>The real murderer of Archbishop Darboy is Thiers. The Commune again and
  again had offered to exchange the archbishop, and ever so many priests in the
  bargain, against the single Blanqui, then in the hands of Thiers. Thiers
  obstinately refused. He knew that with Blanqui he would give the Commune a
  head; while the archbishop would serve his purpose best in the shape of a
  corpse. </p>

  <p>Thiers acted upon the precedent of Cavaignac. How, in June 1848, did not
  Cavaignac and his men of order raise shouts of horror by stigmatizing the
  insurgents as the assassins of Archbishop Affre! They knew perfectly well
  that the archbishop had been shot by the <a href="ch03.htm#F">soldiers of
  order</a>. M. Jacquemet, the archbishop&rsquo;s vicar-general, present on the
  spot, had immediately afterwards handed them in his evidence to that effect.
  </p>

  <p>All the chorus of calumny, which the Party of Order never fail, in their
  orgies of blood, to raise against their victims, only proves that the
  bourgeois of our days considers himself the legitimate successor to the baron
  of old, who thought every weapon in his own hand fair against the plebeian,
  while in the hands of the plebeian a weapon of any kind constituted in itself
  a crime. </p>

  <p>The conspiracy of the ruling class to break down the revolution by a civil
  war carried on under the patronage of the foreign invader &ndash; a
  conspiracy which we have traced from the very 4th of September down to the
  entrance of MacMahon&rsquo;s praetorians through the gate of St. Cloud
  &ndash; culminated in the carnage of Paris. Bismarck gloats over the ruins of
  Paris, in which he saw perhaps the first installment of that general
  destruction of great cities he had prayed for when still a simple Rural in
  the Prussian <em>Chambre introuvable</em> of 1849.<sup class="ednote"><a
  href="#H" name="Hb">[H]</a></sup> He gloats over the cadavers of the Paris
  proletariat. For him, this is not only the extermination of revolution, but
  the extinction of France, now decapitated in reality, and by the French
  government itself. With the shallowness characteristic of all successful
  statesmen, he sees but the surface of this tremendous historic event.
  Whenever before has history exhibited the spectacle of a conqueror crowning
  his victory by turning into, not only the gendarme, but the hired bravo of
  the conquered government? There existed no war between Prussia and the
  Commune of Paris. On the contrary, the Commune had accepted the peace
  preliminaries, and Prussia had announced her neutrality. Prussia was,
  therefore, no belligerent. She acted the part of a bravo, a cowardly bravo,
  because incurring no danger; a hired bravo, because stipulating beforehand
  the payment of her blood-money of 500 millions on the fall of Paris. And
  thus, at last, came out the true character of the war, ordained by
  Providence, as a chastisement of godless and debauched France by pious and
  moral Germany! And this unparalleled breach of the law of nations, even as
  understood by the old-world lawyers, instead of arousing the
  &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; governments of Europe to declare the felonious
  Prussian government, the mere tool of the St. Petersburg Cabinet, an outlaw
  amongst nations, only incites them to consider whether the few victims who
  escape the double cordon around Paris are not to be given up to the hangman
  of Versailles! </p>

  <p>That, after the most tremendous war of modern times, the conquering and
  the conquered hosts should fraternize for the common massacre of the
  proletariat &ndash; this unparalleled event does indicate, not, as Bismarck
  thinks, the final repression of a new society up heaving, but the crumbling
  into dust of bourgeois society. The highest heroic effort of which old
  society is still capable is national war; and this is now proved to be a mere
  governmental humbug, intended to defer the struggle of classes, and to be
  thrown aside as soon as that class struggle bursts out into civil war. Class
  rule is no longer able to disguise itself in a national uniform; the national
  governments are <em>one</em> as against the proletariat! </p>

  <p>After Whit-Sunday, 1871, there can be neither peace nor truce possible
  between the working men of France and the appropriators of their produce. The
  iron hand of a mercenary soldiery may keep for a time both classes tied down
  in common oppression. But the battle must break out again and again in
  ever-growing dimensions, and there can be no doubt as to who will be the
  victor in the end &ndash; the appropriating few, or the immense working
  majority. And the French working class is only the advanced guard of the
  modern proletariat. </p>

  <p>While the European governments thus testify, before Paris, to the
  international character of class rule, they cry down the <a
  href="../../../../../glossary/orgs/i/n.htm#iwma">International Working
  Men&rsquo;s Association</a> &ndash; the international counter-organization of
  labor against the cosmopolitan conspiracy of capital &ndash; as the head
  fountain of all these disasters. Thiers denounced it as the despot of labor,
  pretending to be its liberator. Picard ordered that all communications
  between the French Internationals and those abroad be cut off; Count Jaubert,
  Thiers&rsquo; mummified accomplice of 1835, declares it the great problem of
  all civilized governments to weed it out. The Rurals roar against it, and the
  whole European press joins the chorus. An honorable French writer [Robinet],
  completely foreign to our Association, speaks as follows:</p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The members of the Central Committee of the National
  Guard, as well as the greater part of the members of the Commune, are the
  most active, intelligent, and energetic minds of the International Working
  Men&rsquo;s Association... men who are thoroughly honest, sincere,
  intelligent, devoted, pure, and fanatical in the <em>good</em> sense of the
  word.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>The police-tinged bourgeois mind naturally figures to itself the
  International Working Men&rsquo;s Association as acting in the manner of a
  secret conspiracy, its central body ordering, from time to time, explosions
  in different countries. Our Association is, in fact, nothing but the
  international bond between the most advanced working men in the various
  countries of the civilized world. Wherever, in whatever shape, and under
  whatever conditions the class struggle obtains any consistency, it is but
  natural that members of our Association, should stand in the foreground. The
  soil out of which it grows is modern society itself. It cannot be stamped out
  by any amount of carnage. To stamp it out, the governments would have to
  stamp out the despotism of capital over labor &ndash; the condition of their
  own parasitical existence. </p>

  <p>Working men&rsquo;s Paris, with its Commune, will be forever celebrated as
  the glorious harbinger of a new society. Its martyrs are enshrined in the
  great heart of the working class. Its exterminators history has already
  nailed to that eternal pillory from which all the prayers of their priest
  will not avail to redeem them. </p>

  <p class="information"><sup class="ednote"><a href="#Ab"
  name="A">[A]</a></sup> This name was given to the Versailles soldiers of
  royalist sympathies recruited in Brittany, by analogy with those who took
  part in the counter-revolutionary royalist insurrection in North-Western
  France during the French Revolution at the end of the 18th century. </p>

  <p class="information"><sup class="ednote"><a href="#Bb"
  name="B">[B]</a></sup> Under the impact of the proletarian revolution in
  Paris which led to the establishment of the Commune, revolutionary mass
  actions of a similar nature took place in Lyons and Marseilles. However,
  these were brutally crushed by French government troops. </p>

  <p class="information"><sup class="ednote"><a href="#Cb"
  name="C">[C]</a></sup> Under the law concerning the procedure of military
  courts, submitted by Dufaure to the National Assembly, it was ruled that
  cases were to be investigated and sentences carried out within 48 hours. </p>

  <p class="information"><sup class="ednote"><a href="#Db"
  name="D">[D]</a></sup> This trade treaty between England and France was
  concluded on January 23, 1860. Under its terms France was to abandon her
  prohibitive Customs policy and replace it by introducing new import duties.
  As result of the influx of English goods to France, competition in the home
  market dramatically increased, causing dissatisfaction among some French
  manufacturers. </p>

  <p class="information"><sup class="ednote"><a href="#Eb"
  name="E">[E]</a></sup> This refers to the reign of terror and bloody
  repression in Ancient Rome at the various stages of the crisis of the
  slave-owning Roman Republic in the first century B.C.E. &ndash; Sulla&rsquo;s
  dictatorship (in 82-79 B.C.E.), and the first and second triumvirates:
  Pompey, Caesar, Crassus (60-53) and Octavian, Antonius, Lepidus (43-36
  B.C.E.) respectively. </p>

  <p class="information"><sup class="ednote"><a href="#Fb"
  name="F">[F]</a></sup> In August 1814, during the war between Britain and the
  United States, British troops seized Washington and burned the Capitol, the
  White House and other public buildings to the ground. In October 1860, during
  the war waged by Britain and France against China (the first of the Opium
  Wars), British and French troops pillaged and burned down the summer palace
  of the Chinese emperors near Beijing, a treasure-house of Chinese art and
  architecture. </p>

  <p class="information"><sup class="ednote"><a href="#Gb"
  name="G">[G]</a></sup> In ancient Rome the privileged life-guards of the
  general or emperor; they constantly took part in internal disturbances. Later
  the word &ldquo;praetorians&rdquo; became the symbol of the mercenary,
  tyrannical nature of the militarists. </p>

  <p class="information"><sup class="ednote"><a href="#Hb"
  name="H">[H]</a></sup> This is what Marx called the Prussian Assembly by
  analogy with the French <a href="ch03.htm#I">Chambre introuvable</a>. The
  Assembly elected in January and February 1849 consisted of two chambers: the
  first was a privileged aristocratic &ldquo;chamber of the gentry"; the
  composition of the second was determined by two-stage elections in which only
  the so-called &ldquo;independent&rdquo; Prussians took part. Elected to the
  second chamber, Bismarck became one of the leaders of the extremely
  reactionary Junker group. </p>
