  &amp; Thiers&rsquo; Reactionary Massacres] </h3>
  <hr class="end">

  <p class="skip"> </p>

  <p>Armed Paris was the only serious obstacle in the way of the
  counter-revolutionary conspiracy. Paris was, therefore, to be disarmed. </p>

  <p>On this point, the Bordeaux Assembly [National Assembly] was sincerity
  itself. If the roaring rant of its Rurals had not been audible enough, the
  surrender of Paris by Thiers to the tender mercies of the triumvirate of
  Vinoy the <em>Decembriseur</em>, Valentin the Bonapartist <em>gendarme</em>,
  and Aurelles de Paladine the Jesuit general, would have cut off even the last
  subterfuge of doubt. </p>

  <p>But while insultingly exhibiting the true purpose of the disarmament of
  Paris, the conspirators asked her to lay down her arms on a pretext which was
  the most glaring, the most barefaced of lies. The artillery of the Paris
  National Guard, said Thiers, belonged to the state, and to the state it must
  be returned. The fact was this: From the very day of the capitulation, by
  which Bismarck&rsquo;s prisoners had signed the surrender of France, but
  reserved to themselves a numerous bodyguard for the express purpose of cowing
  Paris, Paris stood on the watch. The National Guard reorganized themselves
  and entrusted their supreme control to a Central Committee elected by their
  whole body, save some fragments of the old Bonapartist formations. On the eve
  of the entrance of the Prussians into Paris, the Central Committee took
  measures for the removal to Montmartre, Belleville, and La Villette, of the
  cannon and <em>mitrailleuses</em> treacherously abandoned by the
  <em>capitulards</em> in and about the very quarters the Prussians were to
  occupy. That artillery had been furnished by the subscriptions of the
  National Guard. As their private property, it was officially recognized in
  the capitulation of January 28, and on that very title exempted from the
  general surrender, into the hands of the conqueror, or arms belonging to the
  government. And Thiers was so utterly destitute of even the flimsiest pretext
  for initiating the war against Paris, that he had to resort to the flagrant
  lie of the artillery of the National Guard being state property! </p>

  <p>The seizure of her artillery was evidently but to serve as the preliminary
  to the general disarmament of Paris, and, therefore, of the Revolution of
  September 4. But that revolution had become the legal status of France. The
  republic, its work, was recognized by the conqueror in the terms of the
  capitulation. After the capitulation, it was acknowledged by all foreign
  powers, and in its name, the National Assembly had been summoned. The Paris
  working men&rsquo;s revolution of September 4 was the only legal title of the
  National Assembly seated at Bordeaux, and of its executive. Without it, the
  National Assembly would at once have to give way to the <em>Corps
  Legislatif</em> elected in 1869 by universal suffrage under French, not under
  Prussian, rule, and forcibly dispersed by the arm of the revolution. Thiers
  and his ticket-of-leave men would have had to capitulate for safe conducts
  signed by Louis Bonaparte, to save them from a voyage to Cayenne<sup
  class="ednote"><a href="#A" name="Ab">[A]</a></sup>. The National Assembly,
  with its power of attorney to settle the terms of peace with Prussia, was but
  an incident of that revolution, the true embodiment of which was still armed
  Paris, which had initiated it, undergone for it a five-months&rsquo; siege,
  with its horrors of famine, and made her prolonged resistance, despite
  Trochu&rsquo;s plan, the basis of an obstinate war of defence in the
  provinces. And Paris was now either to lay down her arms at the insulting
  behest of the rebellious slaveholders of Bordeaux, and acknowledge that her
  Revolution of September 4 meant nothing but a simple transfer of power from
  Louis Bonaparte to his royal rivals; or she had to stand forward as the
  self-sacrificing champion of France, whose salvation from ruin and whose
  regeneration were impossible without the revolutionary overthrow of the
  political and social conditions that had engendered the Second Empire, and
  under its fostering care, matured into utter rottenness. Paris, emaciated by
  a five-months&rsquo; famine, did not hesitate one moment. She heroically
  resolved to run all the hazards of a resistance against French conspirators,
  even with Prussian cannon frowning upon her from her own forts. Still, in its
  abhorrence of the civil war into which Paris was to be goaded, the Central
  Committee continued to persist in a merely defensive attitude, despite the
  provocations of the Assembly, the usurpations of the Executive, and the
  menacing concentration of troops in and around Paris. </p>

  <p>Thiers opened the civil war by sending Vinoy, at the head of a multitude
  of <em>sergents-de-ville</em>, and some regiments of the line, upon a
  nocturnal expedition against Montmartre, there to seize, by surprise, the
  artillery of the National Guard. It is well known how this attempt broke down
  before the resistance of the National Guard and the fraternization of the
  line with the people. Aurelles de Paldine had printed beforehand his bulletin
  of victory, and Thiers held ready the placards announcing his measures of
  coup d&rsquo;etat. Now these had to be replaced by Thiers&rsquo; appeals,
  imparting his magnanimous resolve to leave the National Guard in the
  possession of their arms, with which, he said, he felt sure they would rally
  round the government against the rebels. Out of 300,000 National guards, only
  300 responded to this summons to rally around little Thiers against
  themselves. The glorious working men&rsquo;s Revolution of March 18 took
  undisputed sway of Paris. The Central Committee was its provisional
  government. Europe seemed, for a moment, to doubt whether its recent
  sensational performances of state and war had any reality in them, or whether
  they were the dreams of a long bygone past. </p>

  <p>From March 18 to the entrance of the Versailles troops into Paris, the
  proletarian revolution remained so free from the acts of violence in which
  the revolutions &ndash; and still more the counter-revolutions &ndash; of the
  &ldquo;better classes&rdquo; abound, that no facts were left to its opponents
  to cry out about, but the executions of Generals Lecomte and Clement Thomas,
  and the affair of the Place Vendome. </p>

  <p>One of the Bonapartist officers engaged in the nocturnal attempt against
  Montmartre, General Lecomte, had four times ordered the 81st line regiment to
  fire at an unarmed gathering in the Place Pigalle, and on their refusal
  fiercely insulted them. Instead of shooting women and children, his own men
  shot him. The inveterate habits acquired by the soldiery under the training
  of the enemies of the working class are, of course, not likely to change the
  very moment these soldiers change sides. The same men executed Clement
  Thomas. </p>

  <p>&ldquo;General&rdquo; Clement Thomas, a malcontent
  ex-quartermaster-sergeant, had, in the latter times of Louis Philippe&rsquo;s
  reign, enlisted at the office of the republican newspaper <em>Le
  National</em>, there to serve in the double capacity of responsible
  man-of-straw (<em>gerant responsable</em>) and of duelling bully to that very
  combative journal. After the February Revolution, the men of the
  <em>National</em> having got into power, they metamorphosed this old
  quarter-master-sergeant into a general on the eve of the butchery of June
  &ndash; of which he, like Jules Favre, was one of the sinister plotters, and
  became one of the most dastardly executioners. Then he and his generalship
  disappeared for a long time, to again rise to the surface on November 1,
  1870. The day before, the Government of National Defence, caught at the Hotel
  de Ville, had solemnly pledged their parole to Blanqui, Flourens, and other
  representatives of the working class, to abdicate their usurped power into
  the hands of a commune to be freely elected by Paris.<sup class="ednote"><a
  href="#B" name="Bb">[B]</a></sup> Instead of keeping their word, they let
  loose on Paris the Bretons of Trochu, who now replaced the Corsicans of
  Bonaparte.<sup class="ednote"><a href="#C" name="Cb">[C]</a></sup> General
  Tamisier alone, refusing to sully his name by such a breach of faith,
  resigned the commandership-in-chief of the National Guard, and in his place
  Clement Thomas for once became again a general. During the whole of his
  tenure of command, he made war, not upon the Prussians, but upon the Paris
  National Guard. He prevented their general armament, pitted the bourgeois
  battalions against the working men&rsquo;s battalions, weeded out officers
  hostile to Trochu&rsquo;s &ldquo;plan,&rdquo; and disbanded, under the stigma
  of cowardice, the very same proletarian battalions whose heroism has now
  astonished their most inveterate enemies. Clement Thomas felt quite proud of
  having reconquered his June pre-eminence as the personal enemy of the working
  class of Paris. Only a few days before March 18, he laid before the War
  Minister, Leflo, a plan of his own for &ldquo;finishing off <em>la fine
  fleur</em> [the cream] of the Paris canaille.&rdquo; After Vinoy&rsquo;s
  rout, he must needs appear upon the scene of action in the quality of an
  amateur spy. The Central Committee and the Paris working men were as much
  responsible for the killing of Clement Thomas and Lecomte as the Princess of
  Wales for the fate of the people crushed to death on the day of her entrance
  into London. </p>

  <p>The massacre of unarmed citizens in Place Vendome is a myth which M.
  Thiers and the Rurals persistently ignored in the Assembly, entrusting its
  propagation exclusively to the servants&rsquo; hall of European journalism.
  &ldquo;The men of order,&rdquo; the reactionists of Paris, trembled at the
  victory of March 18. To them, it was the signal of popular retribution at
  last arriving. The ghosts of the victims assassinated at their hands from the
  days of June 1848, down to January 22, 1871,<sup class="ednote"><a href="#D"
  name="Db">[D]</a></sup> arose before their faces. Their panic was their only
  punishment. Even the <em>sergents-de-ville</em>, instead of being disarmed
  and locked up, as ought to have been done, had the gates of Paris flung open
  wide for their safe retreat to Versailles. The men of order were left not
  only unharmed, but allowed to rally and quietly seize more than one
  stronghold in the very centre of Paris. This indulgence of the Central
  Committee &ndash; this magnanimity of the armed working men &ndash; so
  strangely at variance with the habits of the &ldquo;Party of Order,&rdquo;
  the latter misinterpreted as mere symptoms of conscious weakness. Hence their
  silly plan to try, under the cloak of an unarmed demonstration, what Vinoy
  had failed to perform with his cannon and <em>mitrailleuses</em>. On March
  22, a riotous mob of swells started from the quarters of luxury, all the
  <em>petits creves</em> in their ranks, and at their head the notorious
  familiars of the empire &ndash; the Heeckeren, Coetlogon, Henri de Pene, etc.
  Under the cowardly pretence of a pacific demonstration, this rabble, secretly
  armed with the weapons of the bravo <span class="context">[i.e. hired
  assassin]</span>, fell into marching order, ill-treated and disarmed the
  detached patrols and sentries of the National Guard they met with on their
  progress, and, on debouching from the Rue de la Paix, with the cry of
  &ldquo;Down with the Central Committee! Down with the assassins! The National
  Assembly forever!&rdquo; attempted to break through the line drawn up there,
  and thus to carry by surprise the headquarters of the National Guard in the
  Place Vendome. In reply to their pistol-shots, the regular
  <em>sommations</em> (the French equivalent of the English Riot Act)<sup
  class="ednote"><a href="#E" name="Eb">[E]</a></sup> were made, and, proving
  ineffective, fire was commanded by the general [Bergeret] of the National
  Guard. One volley dispersed into wild flight the silly coxcombs, who expected
  that the mere exhibition of their &ldquo;respectability&rdquo; would have the
  same effect upon the Revolution of Paris as Joshua&rsquo;s trumpets upon the
  walls of Jericho. The runaways left behind them two National Guards killed,
  nine severely wounded (among them a member of the Central Committee
  [Maljournal]), and the whole scene of their exploit strewn with revolvers,
  daggers, and sword-canes, in evidence of the &ldquo;unarmed&rdquo; character
  of their &ldquo;pacific&rdquo; demonstration. When, on June 13, 1849, the
  National Guard made a really pacific demonstration in protest against the
  felonious assault of French troops upon Rome, Changarnier, then general of
  the Party of Order, was acclaimed by the National Assembly, and especially by
  M. Thiers, as the savior of society, for having launched his troops from all
  sides upon these unarmed men, to shoot and sabre them down, and to trample
  them under their horses&rsquo; feet. Paris, then was placed under a state of
  siege. Dufaure hurried through the Assembly new laws of repression. New
  arrests, new proscriptions &ndash; a new reign of terror set in. But the
  lower orders manage these things otherwise. The Central Committee of 1871
  simply ignored the heroes of the &ldquo;pacific demonstration"; so much so,
  that only two days later, they were enabled to muster under Admiral Saisset,
  for that <em>armed</em> demonstration, crowned by the famous stampede to
  Versailles. In their reluctance to continue the civil war opened by
  Thiers&rsquo; burglarious attempt on Montmartre, the Central Committee made
  themselves, this time, guilty of a decisive mistake in not at once marching
  upon Versailles, then completely helpless, and thus putting an end to the
  conspiracies of Thiers and his Rurals. Instead of this, the Party of Order
  was again allowed to try its strength at the ballot box, on March 26, the day
  of the election of the Commune. Then, in the <em>mairies</em> of Paris, they
  exchanged bland words of conciliation with their too generous conquerors,
  muttering in their hearts solemn vows to exterminate them in due time. </p>

  <p>Now, look at the reverse of the medal. Thiers opened his second campaign
  against Paris in the beginning of April. The first batch of Parisian
  prisoners brought into Versailles was subjected to revolting atrocities,
  while Ernest Picard, with his hands in his trousers&rsquo; pockets, strolled
  about jeering them, and while Mesdames Thiers and Favre, in the midst of
  their ladies of honor (?) applauded, from the balcony, the outrages of the
  Versailles mob. The captured soldiers of the line were massacred in cold
  blood; our brave friend, General Duval, the iron-founder, was shot without
  any form of trial. Galifet, the kept man of his wife, so notorious for her
  shameless exhibitions at the orgies of the Second Empire, boasted in a
  proclamation of having commanded the murder of a small troop of National
  Guards, with their captain and lieutenant, surprised and disarmed by his
  Chasseurs. Vinoy, the runaway, was appointed by Thiers, Grand Cross of the
  Legion of Honor, for his general order to shoot down every soldier of the
  line taken in the ranks of the Federals. Desmaret, the Gendarme, was
  decorated for the treacherous butcher-like chopping in pieces of the
  high-souled and chivalrous Flourens, who had saved the heads of the
  Government of Defence on October 31, 1870.<sup class="ednote"><a href="#F"
  name="Fb">[F]</a></sup> &ldquo;The encouraging particulars&rdquo; of his
  assassination were triumphantly expatiated upon by Thiers in the National
  Assembly. With the elated vanity of a parliamentary Tom Thumb permitted to
  play the part of a Tamerlane, he denied the rebels the right of neutrality
  for ambulances. Nothing more horrid than that monkey allowed for a time to
  give full fling to his tigerish instincts, as foreseen by
  Voltaire.[<em>Candide</em>, Ch. 22](See <a href="news.htm">news articles</a>)
  </p>

  <p>After the decree of the Commune of April 7, ordering reprisals and
  declaring it to be the duty &ldquo;to protect Paris against the cannibal
  exploits of the Versailles banditti, and to demand an eye for an eye, a tooth
  for a tooth,&rdquo; <sup class="ednote"><a href="#G" name="Gb">[G]</a></sup>
  Thiers did not stop the barbarous treatment of prisoners, moreover, insulting
  them in his bulletins as follows: &ldquo;Never have more degraded
  countenances of a degraded democracy met the afflicted gazes of honest
  men&rdquo; &ndash; honest, like Thiers himself and his ministerial
  ticket-of-leave men. Still, the shooting of prisoners was suspended for a
  time. Hardly, however, had Thiers and his Decembrist generals <span
  class="context">[of the December 2, 1851 coup by Louis Bonaparte]</span>
  become aware that the Communal decree of reprisals was but an empty threat,
  that even their gendarme spies caught in Paris under the disguise of National
  Guards, that even <em>sergents-de-ville</em>, taken with incendiary shells
  upon them, were spared &ndash; when the wholesale shooting of prisoners was
  resumed and carried on uninterruptedly to the end. Houses to which National
  Guards had fled were surrounded by gendarmes, inundated with petroleum (which
  here occurs for the first time in this war), and then set fire to, the
  charred corpses being afterwards brought out by the ambulance of the Press at
  the Ternes. Four National Guards having surrendered to a troop of mounted
  Chasseurs at Belle Epine, on April 25, were afterwards shot down, one after
  another, by the captain, a worthy man of Gallifet&rsquo;s. One of his four
  victims, left for dead, Scheffer, crawled back to the Parisian outposts, and
  deposed to this fact before a commission of the Commune. When Tolain
  interpellated the War Minister upon the report of this commission, the Rurals
  drowned his voice and forbade Leflo to answer. It would be an insult to their
  &ldquo;glorious&rdquo; army to speak of its deeds. The flippant tone in which
  Thiers&rsquo; bulletin announced the bayoneting of the Federals, surprised
  asleep at Moulin Saquet, and the wholesale fusillades at Clamart shocked the
  nerves even of the not over-sensitive London <em>Times</em>. But it would be
  ludicrous today to attempt recounting the merely preliminary atrocities
  committed by the bombarders of Paris and the fomenters of a
  slaveholders&rsquo; rebellion protected by foreign invasion. Amidst all these
  horrors, Thiers, forgetful of his parliamentary laments on the terrible
  responsibility weighing down his dwarfish shoulders, boasts in his bulletins
  that <em>l&rsquo;Assemblee siege paisiblement</em> (the Assembly continues
  meeting in peace), and proves by his constant carousals, now with Decembrist
  generals, now with German princes, that his digestion is not troubled in the
  least, not even by the ghosts of Lecomte and Clement Thomas. </p>

  <p class="information"><sup class="ednote"><a href="#Bb"
  name="B">[B]</a></sup> On October 31, 1870, upon the receipt of news that the
  Government of National Defense had decided to start negotiations with the
  Prussians, the Paris workers and revolutionary sections of the National Guard
  rose up in revolt. They seized the town hall and set up their revolutionary
  government &ndash; the Committee of Public Safety, headed by Blanqui. Under
  pressure from the workers the Government of National Defense promised to
  resign and schedule national elections to the Commune for November 1. The
  government then, with the aid of some loyal battalions of the National Guard,
  seized the town hall by force of arms and re-established its domination. </p>

  <p class="information"><sup class="ednote"><a href="#Cb"
  name="C">[C]</a></sup> <em>Bretons </em> &ndash; Breton Mobile Guard which
  Trochu used as gendarmes to put down the revolutionary movement in Paris.<br>

  corps during the Second Empire. </p>

  <p class="information"><sup class="ednote"><a href="#Db"
  name="D">[D]</a></sup> On January 22, 1871, the Paris proletariat and the
  National Guards held a revolutionary demonstration initiated by the
  Blanquists. They demanded the overthrow of the government and the
  establishment of a Commune. By order of the Government of National Defense,
  the Breton Mobile Guard, which was defending the town hall, opened fire on
  the demonstrators. After massacring the workers, the government began
  preparations to surrender Paris to the Germans. </p>

  under the laws of most bourgeois states, this demand is repeated three times,
  following which the armed police are entitled to resort to force. <em>The
  Riot Act </em> was introduced in England in 1715. It prohibited &ldquo;rebel
  gatherings&rdquo; of more than 12 people in a group, giving the authorities
  the right to use force if the crowd did not disperse within an hour after the
  reading out of the sommations three times. </p>
