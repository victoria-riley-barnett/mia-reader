  <h2>The Third Address<br>
  May, 1871 </h2>

  <h3>[France Capitulates &amp; the Government of Thiers] </h3>
  <hr class="end">

  <p class="skip"> </p>

  <p>In September 4, 1870, when the working men of Paris proclaimed the
  republic, which was almost instantaneously acclaimed throughout France,
  without a single voice of dissent, a cabal of place-hunting barristers, with
  Thiers for their statesman, and Trochu for their general, took hold of the
  Hotel de Ville. At that time they were imbued with so fanatical a faith in
  the mission of Paris to represent France in all epochs of historical crisis
  that, to legitimate their usurped titles as governors of France, they thought
  it quite sufficient to produce their lapsed mandates as representatives of
  Paris. </p>

  <p>In our <a href="ch02.htm">second address</a> on the late war, five days
  after the rise of these men, we told you who they were. Yet, in the turmoil
  of surprise, with the real leaders of the working class still shut up in
  Bonapartist prisons and the Prussians already marching on Paris, Paris bore
  with their assumption of power, on the express condition that it was to be
  wielded for the single purpose of national defence. Paris, however, was not
  to be defended without arming its working class, organizing them into an
  effective force, and training their ranks by the war itself. But Paris armed
  was the revolution armed. A victory of Paris over the Prussian aggressor
  would have been a victory of the French workmen over the French capitalist
  and his state parasites. In this conflict between national duty and class
  interest, the Government of National Defence did not hesitate one moment to
  turn into a Government of National Defection. </p>

  <p>The first step they took was to send Thiers on a roving tour to all the
  courts of Europe, there to beg mediation by offering the barter of the
  republic for a king. Four months after the commencement of the siege [of
  Paris], when they thought the opportune moment came for breaking the first
  word of capitulation, Trochu, in the presence of Jules Favre, and others of
  his colleagues, addressed the assembled mayors of Paris in these terms: </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The first question put to me by my colleagues on the
  very evening of the 4th of September was this: Paris, can it, with any chance
  of success, stand a siege by the Prussian army? I did not hesitate to answer
  in the negative. Some of my colleagues here present will warrant the truth of
  my words and the persistence of my opinion. I told them, in these very terms,
  that, under the existing state of things, the attempt of Paris to hold out a
  siege by the Prussian army would be a folly. Without doubt, I added, it would
  be an heroic folly; but that would be all.... The events [managed by himself]
  have not given the lie to my prevision.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>This nice little speech of Trochu was afterwards published by M. Carbon,
  one of the mayors present. </p>

  <p>Thus, on the very evening of the proclamation of the republic,
  Trochu&rsquo;s &ldquo;plan&rdquo; was known to his colleagues to be the
  capitulation of Paris. If national defence has been more than a pretext for
  the personal government of Thiers, Favre, and Co., the upstarts of September
  4 would have abdicated on the 5th &ndash; would have initiated the Paris
  people into Trochu&rsquo;s &ldquo;plan,&rdquo; and called upon them to
  surrender at once, or to take their own fate into their own hands. Instead of
  this, the infamous impostors resolved upon curing the heroic folly of Paris
  by a regimen of famine and broken heads, and to dupe her in the meanwhile by
  ranting manifestos, holding forth that Trochu, &ldquo;the governor of Paris,
  will never capitulate", and Jules Favre, the foreign minister, will
  &ldquo;not cede an inch of our territory, nor a stone of our
  fortresses.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>In a letter to Gambetta, the very same Jules Favre avows that what they
  were &ldquo;defending&rdquo; against were not the Prussian soldiers, but the
  working men of Paris. During the whole continuance of the siege, the
  Bonapartist cut-throats, whom Trochu had wisely entrusted with the command of
  the Paris army, exchanged, in their intimate correspondence, ribald jokes at
  the well-understood mockery of defence. (See, for instance, the
  correspondence of Alphonse Simon Guiod, supreme commander of the artillery of
  the Army of Defence of Paris and Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor, to
  Suzanne, general of division of artillery, a correspondence published by the
  <a href="../../../../../glossary/periodicals/r/e.htm#rfjo"><i>Journal
  officiel</i></a> of the Commune.) The mask of the true heroism was at last
  dropped on <a href="../../../../../glossary/orgs/f/r.htm#january-28">January
  28, 1871</a>. With the true heroism of utter self-debasement, the Government
  of National Defence, in their capitulation, came out as the government of
  France by Bismarck&rsquo;s prisoners &ndash; a part so base that Louis
  Bonaparte himself had, at Sedan, shrunk from accepting it. After the events
  of March 18 on their wild flight to Versailles, the <em>capitulards</em> left
  in the hands of Paris the documentary evidence of their treason, to destroy
  which, as the Commune says in its manifesto to the provinces, &ldquo;those
  men would not recoil from battering Paris into a heap of ruins washed by a
  sea of blood." </p>

  <p>To be eagerly bent upon such a consummation, some of the leading members
  of the Government of Defence had, besides, most peculiar reasons of their
  own. </p>

  <p>Shortly after the conclusion of the armistice, M. Milliere, one of the
  representatives of Paris to the National Assembly, now shot by express orders
  of Jules Favre, published a series of authentic legal documents in proof that
  Jules Favre, living in concubinage with the wife of a drunken resident at
  Algiers, had, by a most daring concoction of forgeries, spread over many
  years, contrived to grasp, in the name of the children of his adultery, a
  large succession, which made him a rich man, and that, in a lawsuit
  undertaken by the legitimate heirs, he only escaped exposure by the
  connivance of the Bonapartist tribunals. As these dry legal documents were
  not to be got rid of by any amount of rhetorical horse-power, Jules Favre,
  for the first time in his life, held his tongue, quietly awaiting the
  outbreak of the civil war, in order, then, frantically to denounce the people
  of Paris as a band of escaped convicts in utter revolt against family,
  religion, order, and property. This same forger had hardly got into power,
  after September 4, when he sympathetically let loose upon society Pic and
  Taillefer, convicted, even under the empire, of forgery in the scandalous
  affair of &ldquo;<a
  href="../../../../../glossary/periodicals/e/t.htm#l-etendard">Etendard</a>.&rdquo;
  One of these men, Taillefer, having dared to return to Paris under the
  Commune, was at once reinstated in prison; and then Jules Favre exclaimed,
  from the tribune of the National Assembly, that Paris was setting free all
  her jailbirds! </p>

  <p>Ernest Picard, the Joe Miller of the Government of National Defence, who
  appointed himself Finance Minister of the republic after having in vain
  striven to become home minister of the empire, is the brother of one Arthur
  Picard, an individual expelled from the Paris <em>Bourse</em> as a blackleg
  (see report of the Prefecture of Police, dated July 13, 1867), and convicted,
  on his own confession, of theft of 300,000 francs, while manager of one of
  the branches of the <em>Societe Generale</em>,<sup class="ednote"><a
  href="#A" name="Ab">[A]</a></sup> Rue Palestro, No.5 (see report of the
  Prefecture of Police, dated December 11, 1868). This Arthur Picard was made
  by Ernest Picard the editor of his paper, <a
  href="../../../../../glossary/periodicals/e/l.htm#l-electeur-libre"><i>l&rsquo;Electeur
  Libre</i></a>. While the common run of stockjobbers were led astray by the
  official lies of this finance office paper, Arthur was running backwards and
  forwards between the finance office and the <em>Bourse</em>, there to
  discount the disasters of the French army. The whole financial correspondence
  of that worthy pair of brothers fell into the hands of the Commune. </p>

  <p>Jules Ferry, a penniless barrister before September 4, contrived, as mayor
  of Paris during the siege, to job a fortune out of famine. The day on which
  he would have to give an account of his maladministration would be the day of
  his conviction. </p>

  <p>These men, then, could find in the ruins of Paris only their
  tickets-of-leave<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">[1]</a></sup>; they
  were the very men Bismarck wanted. With the help of some shuffling of cards,
  Thiers, hitherto the secret prompter of the government, now appeared at its
  head, with the tickets-of-leave men for his ministers. </p>

  <p>Theirs, that monstrous gnome, has charmed the French bourgeoisie for
  almost half a century, because he is the most consummate intellectual
  expression of their own class corruption. Before he became a statesman, he
  had already proved his lying powers as an historian. The chronicle of his
  public life is the record of the misfortunes of France. Banded, before 1830,
  with the republicans, he slipped into office under Louis Philippe by
  betraying his protector Lafitte, ingratiating himself with the king by
  exciting mob riots against the clergy, during which the church of Saint
  Germain l&rsquo;Auxerrois and the Archbishop&rsquo;s palace were plundered,
  and by acting the minister-spy upon, and the jail-<em>accoucheur</em> of the
  Duchess de Berry.<sup class="ednote"><a href="#B" name="Bb">[B]</a></sup> The
  massacre of the republicans in the Rue Transnonian, and the subsequent
  infamous laws of September against the press and the right of association,
  were his work.<sup class="ednote"><a href="#C" name="Cb">[C]</a></sup>
  Reappearing as the chief of the cabinet in March 1840, he astonished France
  with his plan for fortifying France.<sup class="ednote"><a href="#D"
  name="Db">[D]</a></sup> To the republicans, who denounced this plan as a
  sinister plot against the liberty of Paris, he replied from the tribune of
  the Chamber of Deputies: </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;What! To fancy that any works of fortification could
  ever endanger liberty! And first of all you calumniate any possible
  government in supposing that it could some day attempt to maintain itself by
  bombarding the capital; [...] but that the government would be a hundred
  times more impossible after its victory than before.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>Indeed, no government would ever have dared to bombard Paris from the
  forts, save that government which had previously surrendered these forts to
  the Prussians. </p>

  <p>When King Bomba [Ferdinand II of Spain] tried his hand at Palermo, in
  January 1848, Thiers, then long since out of office, again rose in the
  Chamber of Deputies: </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;You know, gentlemen, what is happening at Palermo.
  You, all of you, shake with horror [in the parliamentary sense] on hearing
  that during 48 hours a large town has been bombarded &ndash; by whom? Was it
  a foreign enemy exercising the rights of war? No, gentlemen, it was by its
  own government. And why? Because the unfortunate town demanded its rights.
  Well, then, for the demand of its rights it has got 48 hours of
  bombardment.... Allow me to appeal to the opinion of Europe. It is doing a
  service to mankind to arise, and to make reverberate, from what is perhaps
  the greatest tribune in Europe, some words [indeed words] of indignation
  against such acts.... When the Regent Espartero, who had rendered services to
  his country [which M. Thiers never did] intended bombarding Barcelona, in
  order to suppress its insurrection, there arose from all parts of the world a
  general outcry of indignation.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>Eighteen months afterwards, M. Thiers was amongst the fiercest defenders
  of the bombardment of Rome by a French army.<sup class="ednote"><a href="#E"
  name="Eb">[E]</a></sup> In fact, the fault of King Bomba seems to have
  consisted in this only &ndash; that he limited his bombardment to 48 hours.
  </p>

  <p>A few days before the February Revolution, fretting at the long exile from
  place and pelf to which Guizot had condemned him, and sniffing in the air the
  scent of an approaching popular commotion, Thiers, in that pseudo-heroic
  style which won him the nickname <em>Mirabeau-mouche</em> [Mirabeau the fly],
  declared, to the Chamber of Deputies: </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;I am of the party of revolution, not only in France,
  but in Europe. I wish the government of the revolution to remain in the hands
  of moderate men... but if that government should fall into the hand of ardent
  minds, even into those of radicals, I shall, for all that, not desert my
  cause. I shall always be of the party of the revolution.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>The February Revolution came. Instead of displacing the Guizot Cabinet by
  the Thiers Cabinet, as the little man had dreamt, it superseded Louis
  Philippe by the republic. On the first day of the popular victory, he
  carefully hid himself, forgetting that the contempt of the working men
  screened him from their hatred. Still, with his legendary courage, he
  continued to shy the public stage, until the June [1848] massacres had
  cleared it for his sort of action. Then he became the leading mind of the
  &ldquo;Party of Order&rdquo;<sup class="ednote"><a href="#F"
  name="Fb">[F]</a></sup> and its parliamentary republic, that anonymous
  interregnum, in which all the rival factions of the ruling class conspired
  together to crush the people, and conspired against each other to restore to
  each of them its own monarchy. Then, as now, Thiers denounced the republicans
  as the only obstacle to the consolidation of the republic; then, as now, he
  spoke to the republic as the hangman spoke to Don Carlos: &ldquo;I shall
  assassinate thee, but for thy own good.&rdquo; Now, as then, he will have to
  exclaim on the day after his victory: <em>L&rsquo;Empire est fait</em>
  &ndash; the empire is consummated. </p>

  <p>Despite his hypocritical homilies about the necessary liberties and his
  personal grudge against Louis Bonaparte, who had made a dupe of him, and
  kicked out parliamentarism &ndash; and, outside of its factitious atmosphere,
  the little man is conscious of withering into nothingness &ndash; he had a
  hand in all the infamies of the Second Empire, from the occupation of Rome by
  French troops to the war with Prussia, which he incited by his fierce
  invective against German unity &ndash; not as a cloak of Prussian despotism,
  but as an encroachment upon the vested right of France in German disunion.
  Fond of brandishing, with his dwarfish arms in the face of Europe, the sword
  of the first Napoleon, whose historical shoeblack he had become, his foreign
  policy always culminated in the utter humiliation of France &ndash; from the
  London convention<sup class="ednote"><a href="#G" name="Gb">[G]</a></sup> of
  1840 to the Paris capitulation of 1871, and the present civil war, where he
  hounds on the prisoners of Sedan and Metz<sup class="ednote"><a href="#H"
  name="Hb">[H]</a></sup> against Paris by special permission of Bismarck. </p>

  <p>Despite his versatility of talent and shiftiness of purpose, this man has
  his whole lifetime been wedded to the most fossil routine. It is self-evident
  that to him the deeper undercurrents of modern society remained forever
  hidden; but even the most palpable changes on its surface were abhorrent to a
  brain (all the vitality of which) had fled to the tongue. Thus, he never
  tired of denouncing as a sacrilege any deviation from the old French
  protective system. </p>

  <p>When a minister of Louis Philippe, he railed at railways as a wild
  chimera; and when in opposition under Louis Bonaparte, he branded as a
  profanation every attempt to reform the rotten French army system. Never in
  his long political career has he been guilty of a single &ndash; even the
  smallest &ndash; measure of any practical use. Thiers was consistent only in
  his greed for wealth and his hatred of the men that produce it. Having
  entered his first ministry, under Louis Philippe, poor as Job, he left it a
  millionaire. His last ministry under the same king (of March 1, 1840) exposed
  him to public taunts of peculation in the Chamber of Deputies, to which he
  was content to reply by tears &ndash; a commodity he deals in as freely as
  Jules Favre, or any other crocodile. At Bordeaux, his first measure for
  saving France from impending financial ruin was to endow himself with three
  millions a year, the first and the last word of the &ldquo;Economical
  Republic,&rdquo; the vista of which he had opened to his Paris electors in
  1869. One of his former colleagues of the Chamber of Deputies of 1830,
  himself a capitalist and, nevertheless, a devoted member of the Paris
  Commune, M. Beslay, lately addressed Thiers thus in a public placard: </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The enslavement of labor by capital has always been
  the cornerstone of your policy, and from the very day you saw the Republic of
  Labor installed at the Hotel de Ville, you have never ceased to cry out to
  France: &lsquo;These are criminals!&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>

  <p>A master in small state roguery, a virtuoso in perjury and treason, a
  craftsman in all the petty strategems, cunning devices, and base perfidies of
  parliamentary warfare; never scrupling, when out of office, to fan a
  revolution, and to stifle it in blood when at the helm of the state; with
  class prejudices standing him in the place of ideas, and vanity in the place
  of a heart; his private life as infamous as his public life is odious &ndash;
  even now, when playing the part of a French Sulla, he cannot help setting off
  the abomination of his deeds by the ridicule of his ostentation. </p>

  <p>The capitulation of Paris, by surrendering to Prussia not only Paris, but
  all France, closed the long-continued intrigues of treason with the enemy,
  which the usurpers of September 4 had begun, as Trochu himself said, on the
  very same day. On the other hand, it initiated the civil war they were now to
  wage, with the assistance of Prussia, against the republic and Paris. The
  trap was laid in the very terms of the capitulation. At that time, above
  one-third of the territory was in the hands of the enemy, the capital was cut
  off from the provinces, all communications were disorganized. To elect, under
  such circumstances, a real representation of France was impossible, unless
  ample time were given for preparation. In view of this, the capitulation
  stipulated that a National Assembly must be elected within eight days; so
  that in many parts of France the news of the impending election arrived on
  its eve only. This assembly, moreover, was, by an express clause of the
  capitulation, to be elected for the sole purpose of deciding on peace or war,
  and, eventually, to conclude a treaty of peace. The population could not but
  feel that the terms of the armistice rendered the continuation of the war
  impossible, and that for sanctioning the peace imposed by Bismarck, the worst
  men in France were the best. But not content with these precautions, Thiers
  even before the secret of the armistice had been broached to Paris, set out
  for an electioneering tour through the provinces, there to galvanize back
  into life the Legitimist party, which now, along with the Orleanists, had to
  take the place of the then impossible Bonapartists. He was not afraid of
  them. Impossible as a government of modern France, and, therefore,
  contemptible as rivals, what party were more eligible as tools of
  counter-revolution than the party whose action, in the words of Thiers
  himself (Chamber of Deputies, January 5, 1833), &ldquo;Had always been
  confined to the three resources of foreign invasion, civil war, and
  anarchy&rdquo;? They verily believed in the advent of their long-expected
  retrospective millennium. There were the heels of foreign invasion trampling
  upon France; there was the downfall of an empire, and the captivity of
  Bonaparte; and there they were themselves. The wheel of history had evidently
  rolled back to stop at the &ldquo;Chambers introuvable&rdquo; of 1816.<sup
  class="ednote"><a href="#I" name="Ib">[I]</a></sup> In the assemblies of the
  republic, 1848 to 1851, they had been represented by their educated and
  trained parliamentary champions; it was the rank-and-file of the party which
  now rushed in &ndash; all the Pourceaugnacs of France. <span class="inote">[a
  character in one of Molière&rsquo;s comedies, typifying the dull-witted,
  narrow-minded petty landed gentry.]</span> </p>

  <p>As soon as this Assembly of &ldquo;Rurals"<sup class="ednote"><a href="#J"
  name="Jb">[J]</a></sup> had met at Bordeaux, Thiers made it clear to them
  that the peace preliminaries must be assented to at once, without even the
  honors of a parliamentary debate, as the only conditions on which Prussia
  would permit them to open the war against the republic and Paris, its
  stronghold. The counter-revolution had, in fact, no time to lose. The Second
  Empire had more than doubled the national debt, and plunged all the large
  towns into heavy municipal debts. The war had fearfully swelled the
  liabilities, and mercilessly ravaged the resources of the nation. To complete
  the ruin, the Prussian Shylock was there with his bond for the keep of half a
  million of his soldiers on French soil, his indemnity for five milliards<sup
  class="ednote"><a href="#K" name="Kb">[K]</a></sup>, and interest at 5 per
  cent on the unpaid instalments thereof. Who was to pay this bill? It was only
  by the violent overthrow of the republic that the appropriators of wealth
  could hope to shift onto the shoulders of its producers the cost of a war
  which they, the appropriators, had themselves originated. Thus, the immense
  ruin of France spurred on these patriotic representatives of land and
  capital, under the very eyes and patronage of the invader, to graft upon the
  foreign war a civil war &ndash; a slaveholders&rsquo; rebellion. </p>

  <p>There stood in the way of this conspiracy one great obstacle &ndash;
  Paris. To disarm Paris was the first condition of success. Paris was
  therefore summoned by Thiers to surrender its arms. Then Paris was
  exasperated by the frantic anti-republican demonstrations of the
  &ldquo;Rural&rdquo; Assembly and by Thiers&rsquo; own equivocations about the
  legal status of the republic; by the threat to decapitate and decapitalize
  Paris; the appointment of Orleanist ambassadors; Dufaure&rsquo;s laws on
  over-due commercial bills and house rents<sup class="ednote"><a href="#L"
  name="Lb">[L]</a></sup>, inflicting ruin on the commerce and industry of
  Paris; Pouyer-Quertier&rsquo;s tax of two centimes upon every copy of every
  imaginable publication; the sentences of death against Blanqui and Flourens;
  the suppression of the republican journals; the transfer of the National
  Assembly to Versailles; the renewal of the state of siege declared by
  Palikao, and expired on September 4; the appointment of Vinoy, the
  <em>Décembriseur</em><sup class="ednote"><a href="#M"
  name="Mb">[M]</a></sup>, as governor of Paris &ndash; of Valentin, the
  imperialist <em>gendarme</em>, as its prefect of police &ndash; and of
  D&rsquo;Aurelles de Paladine, the Jesuit general, as the commander-in-chief
  of its National Guard. </p>

  <p>And now we have to address a question to M. Thiers and the men of national
  defence, his under-strappers. It is known that, through the agency of M.
  Pouyer-Quertier, his finance ministers, Thiers had contracted a loan of two
  milliards. Now, is it true or not &ndash; </p>

  <p class="indentb">1. That the business was so managed that a consideration
  of several hundred millions was secured for the private benefit of Thiers,
  Jules Favre, Ernest Picard, Pouyer-Quertier, and Jules Simon? and &ndash; </p>

  <p class="indentb">2. That no money was to be paid down until after the
  &ldquo;pacification&rdquo; of Paris?<sup class="ednote"><a href="#N"
  name="Nb">[N]</a></sup> </p>

  <p>At all events, there must have been something very pressing in the matter,
  for Thiers and Jules Favre, in the name of the majority of the Bordeaux
  Assembly, unblushingly solicited the immediate occupation of Paris by
  Prussian troops. Such, however, was not the game of Bismarck, as he
  sneeringly, and in public, told the admiring Frankfort philistines on his
  return to Germany. </p>
