  <h3>[The Beginning of the Franco-Prussian War] </h3>
  <hr class="end">

  <p class="skip"> </p>

  <p>In the <a href="../../1864/10/27.htm">Inaugural Address</a> of the <a
  href="../../1864/iwma/index.htm">International Working Men&rsquo;s
  Association</a>, of November 1864, we said: </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;If the emancipation of the working classes requires
  their fraternal concurrence, how are they to fulfill that great mission with
  a foreign policy in pursuit of criminal designs, playing upon national
  prejudices, and squandering in piratical wars the people&rsquo;s blood and
  treasure?&rdquo; </p>

  <p>We defined the foreign policy aimed at by the International in these
  words: </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Vindicate the simple laws of morals and justice,
  which ought to govern the relations of private individuals, as the laws
  paramount of the intercourse of nations.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>No wonder that Louis Bonaparte, who usurped power by exploiting the war of
  classes in France, and perpetuated it by periodical wars abroad, should, from
  the first, have treated the International as a dangerous foe. On the eve of
  the plebiscite<sup class="ednote"><a href="#A" name="Ab">[A]</a></sup> he
  ordered a raid on the members of the Administrative Committee of the
  International Working Men&rsquo;s Association throughout France, at Paris,
  Lyons, Rouen, Marseilles, Brest, etc., on the pretext that the International
  was a secret society dabbling in a <em>complot</em> for his assassination, a
  pretext soon after exposed in its full absurdity by his own judges. What was
  the real crime of the French branches of the International? They told the
  French people publicly and emphatically that voting the plebiscite was voting
  despotism at home and war abroad. It has been, in fact, their work that in
  all the great towns, in all the industrial centres of France, the working
  class rose like one man to reject the plebiscite. Unfortunately, the balance
  was turned by the heavy ignorance of the rural districts. The stock
  exchanges, the cabinets, the ruling classes, and the press of Europe
  celebrated the plebiscite as a signal victory of the French emperor over the
  French working class; and it was the signal for the assassination, not of an
  individual, but of nations. </p>

  <p>The war plot of July [19] 1870<sup class="ednote"><a href="#B"
  name="Bb">[B]</a></sup> is but an amended edition of the <em>coup
  d&rsquo;etat</em> of December 1851. At first view, the thing seemed so absurd
  that France would not believe in its real good earnest. It rather believed
  the deputy denouncing the ministerial war talk as a mere stock-jobbing trick.
  When, on July 15, war was at last officially announced to the <em>Corps
  Legislatif</em>, the whole Opposition refused to vote the preliminary
  subsidies &ndash; even <a
  href="../../../../../glossary/people/t/h.htm#thiers-louis-adolphe">Thiers</a>
  branded it as &ldquo;detestable&rdquo;; all the independent journals of Paris
  condemned it, and, wonderful to relate, the provincial press joined in almost
  unanimously. </p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Paris members of the International had again set to work.
  In the <em>Reveil</em> of July 12, they published their manifesto &ldquo;to
  the Workmen of all Nations,&rdquo; from which we extract the following few
  passages: </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Once more,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;on the pretext of
  European equilibrium, of national honor, the peace of the world is menaced by
  political ambitions. French, German, Spanish workmen! Let our voices unite in
  one cry of reprobation against war! </p>

  <p class="quoteb">[...] </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;War for a question of preponderance or a dynasty
  can, in the eyes of workmen, be nothing but a criminal absurdity. In answer
  to the warlike proclamations of those who exempt themselves from the blood
  tax, and find in public misfortunes a source of fresh speculations, we
  protest, we who want peace, labor, and liberty! </p>

  <p class="quoteb">[...] </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Brothers in Germany! Our division would only result
  in the complete triumph of the despotism on both sides of the Rhine... </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Workmen of all countries! Whatever may for the
  present become of our common efforts, we, the members of the International
  Working Men&rsquo;s Association, who know of no frontiers, we send you, as a
  pledge of indissoluble solidarity, the good wishes and the salutations of the
  workmen of France.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>This manifesto of our Paris section was followed by numerous similar
  French addresses, of which we can here only quote the declaration of
  Neuilly-sur-Seine, published in the <em>Marseillaise</em> of July 22: </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The war, is it just? No! The war, is it national?
  No! It is merely dynastic. In the name of humanity, or democracy, and the
  true interests of France, we adhere completely and energetically to the
  protestation of the International against the war.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>These protestations expressed the true sentiments of the French working
  people, as was soon shown by a curious incident. The <a
  href="../../../../../glossary/orgs/d/e.htm#december-10-society">Band of the
  10th of December</a>, first organized under the presidency of Louis
  Bonaparte, having been masqueraded into <em>blouses</em> <span
  class="context">[i.e., to appear as common workers] </span>and let loose on
  the streets of Paris, there to perform the contortions of war fever, the real
  workmen of the Faubourgs <span class="context">[suburbs, workers&rsquo;
  districts]</span> came forward with public peace demonstrations so
  overwhelming that Pietri, the Prefect of Police, thought it prudent to stop
  at once all further street politics, on the plea that the real Paris people
  had given sufficient vent to their pent-up patriotism and exuberant war
  enthusiasm. </p>

  <p>Whatever may be the incidents of Louis Bonaparte&rsquo;s war with Prussia,
  the death-knell of the Second Empire has already sounded at Paris. It will
  end, as it began, by a parody. But let us not forget that it is the
  governments and the ruling classes of Europe who enabled Louis Bonaparte to
  play during 18 years the ferocious farce of the Restored Empire. </p>

  <p>On the German side, the war is a war of defence; but who put Germany to
  the necessity of defending herself? Who enabled Louis Bonaparte to wage war
  upon her? Prussia! It was Bismarck who conspired with that very same Louis
  Bonaparte for the purpose of crushing popular opposition at home, and
  annexing Germany to the Hohenzollern dynasty. If the battle of Sadowa had
  been lost instead of being won, French battalions would have overrun Germany
  as the allies of Prussia. After her victory, did Prussia dream one moment of
  opposing a free Germany to an enslaved France? Just the contrary. While
  carefully preserving all the native beauties of her old system, she
  super-added all the tricks of the Second Empire, its real despotism, and its
  mock democratism, its political shams and its financial jobs, its high-flown
  talk and its low <em>legerdemains</em>. The Bonapartist regime, which till
  then only flourished on one side of the Rhine, had now got its counterfeit on
  the other. From such a state of things, what else could result but war? </p>

  <p>If the German working class allows the present war to lose its strictly
  defensive character and to degenerate into a war against the French people,
  victory of defeat will prove alike disastrous. All the miseries that befell
  Germany after her wars of independence will revive with accumulated
  intensity. </p>

  <p>The principles of the International are, however, too widely spread and
  too firmly rooted amongst the German working class to apprehend such a sad
  consummation. The voices of the French workmen had re-echoed from Germany. A
  mass meeting of workmen, held at Brunswick on July 16, expressed its full
  concurrence with the Paris manifesto, spurned the idea of national antagonism
  to France, and wound up its resolutions with these words: </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;We are the enemies of all wars, but above all of
  dynastic wars. ... With deep sorrow and grief we are forced to undergo a
  defensive war as an unavoidable evil; but we call, at the same time, upon the
  whole German working class to render the recurrence of such an immense social
  misfortune impossible by vindicating for the peoples themselves the power to
  decide on peace and war, and making them masters of their own
  destinies.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>At Chemnitz, a meeting of delegates, representing 50,000 Saxon workmen,
  adopted unanimously a resolution to this effect: </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;In the name of German Democracy, and especially of
  the workmen forming the Democratic Socialist Party, we declare the present
  war to be exclusively dynastic.... We are happy to grasp the fraternal hand
  stretched out to us by the workmen of France.... Mindful of the watchword of
  the International Working Men&rsquo;s Association: Proletarians of all
  countries, unite, we shall never forget that the workmen of all countries are
  our friends and the despots of all countries our enemies.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>The Berlin branch of the International has also replied to the Paris
  manifesto: </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;We,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;join with heart and hand
  your protestation.... Solemnly, we promise that neither the sound of the
  trumpets, nor the roar of the cannon, neither victory nor defeat, shall
  divert us from our common work for the union of the children of toil of all
  countries.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>Be it so! </p>

  <p>In the background of this suicidal strike looms the dark figure of Russia.
  It is an ominous sign that the signal for the present war should have been
  given at the moment when the Moscovite government had just finished its
  strategic lines of railway and was already massing troops in the direction of
  the Prut.<sup class="ednote"><a href="#C" name="Cb">[C]</a></sup> Whatever
  sympathy the Germans may justly claim in a war of defense against Bonapartist
  aggression, they would forfeit at once by allowing the Prussian government to
  call for, or accept the help of, the <a
  href="../../../../../glossary/terms/c/o.htm#cossacks">Cossack</a>. Let them
  remember that after their war of independence against the first Napoleon,
  Germany lay for generations prostrate at the feet of the tsar. </p>

  <p>The English working class stretch the hand of fellowship to the French and
  German working people. They feel deeply convinced that whatever turn the
  impending horrid war may take, the alliance of the working classes of all
  countries will ultimately kill war. The very fact that while official France
  and Germany are rushing into a fratricidal feud, the workmen of France and
  Germany send each other messages of peace and goodwill; this great fact,
  unparalleled in the history of the past, opens the vista of a brighter
  future. It proves that in contrast to old society, with its economical
  miseries and its political delirium, a new society is springing up, whose
  International rule will be <em>Peace</em>, because its national ruler will be
  everywhere the same &ndash; Labour! The pioneer of that new society is the
  International Working Men&rsquo;s Association. </p>

  <p class="information"><sup class="ednote"><a href="#Ab"
  name="A">[A]</a></sup> A plebiscite is a direct vote by an electorate of a
  nation to decide a question of national importance, such as governmental
  policy. Conducted by Napoleon III in May 1870 the questions were so worded
  that it was impossible to express disapproval of the policy of the Second
  Empire without declaring opposition to all democratic reforms for the working
  class. The sections of the First International in France argued that their
  members should not participate in the vote. On the eve of the plebiscite
  members of the Paris Federation were arrested on a charge of conspiring
  against Napoleon III. This pretext was further used by the government to
  launch a campaign of persecution of the members of the International
  throughout France. At the trial of the Paris Federation members (June 22 to
  July 5, 1870), the charge of conspiracy was clearly exposed as without any
  basis. Nevertheless a number of the International&rsquo;s members were
  sentenced to imprisonment based solely on their socialistic beliefs. The
  working class of France responded to these political persecutions with mass
  protests. </p>
