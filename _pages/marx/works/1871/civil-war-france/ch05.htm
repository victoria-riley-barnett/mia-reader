  May, 1871 </h2>

  <h3>[The Paris Commune] </h3>
  <hr class="end">

  <p class="skip"> </p>

  <p>On the dawn of March 18, Paris arose to the thunder-burst of &ldquo;Vive
  la Commune!&rdquo; What is the Commune, that sphinx so tantalizing to the
  bourgeois mind? </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The proletarians of Paris,&rdquo; said the Central
  Committee in its manifesto of March 18, &ldquo;amidst the failures and
  treasons of the ruling classes, have understood that the hour has struck for
  them to save the situation by taking into their own hands the direction of
  public affairs.... They have understood that it is their imperious duty, and
  their absolute right, to render themselves masters of their own destinies, by
  seizing upon the governmental power.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>But the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state
  machinery, and wield it for its own purposes. </p>

  <p>The centralized state power, with its ubiquitous organs of standing army,
  police, bureaucracy, clergy, and judicature &ndash; organs wrought after the
  plan of a systematic and hierarchic division of labor &ndash; originates from
  the days of absolute monarchy, serving nascent middle class society as a
  mighty weapon in its struggle against feudalism. Still, its development
  remained clogged by all manner of medieval rubbish, seignorial rights, local
  privileges, municipal and guild monopolies, and provincial constitutions. The
  gigantic broom of the French Revolution of the 18th century swept away all
  these relics of bygone times, thus clearing simultaneously the social soil of
  its last hinderances to the superstructure of the modern state edifice raised
  under the First Empire, itself the offspring of the coalition wars of old
  semi-feudal Europe against modern France. </p>

  <p>During the subsequent regimes, the government, placed under parliamentary
  control &ndash; that is, under the direct control of the propertied classes
  &ndash; became not only a hotbed of huge national debts and crushing taxes;
  with its irresistible allurements of place, pelf, and patronage, it became
  not only the bone of contention between the rival factions and adventurers of
  the ruling classes; but its political character changed simultaneously with
  the economic changes of society. At the same pace at which the progress of
  modern industry developed, widened, intensified the class antagonism between
  capital and labor, the state power assumed more and more the character of the
  national power of capital over labor, of a public force organized for social
  enslavement, of an engine of class despotism. </p>

  <p>After every revolution marking a progressive phase in the class struggle,
  the purely repressive character of the state power stands out in bolder and
  bolder relief. The Revolution of 1830, resulting in the transfer of
  government from the landlords to the capitalists, transferred it from the
  more remote to the more direct antagonists of the working men. The bourgeois
  republicans, who, in the name of the February Revolution, took the state
  power, used it for the June [1848] massacres, in order to convince the
  working class that &ldquo;social&rdquo; republic means the republic
  entrusting their social subjection, and in order to convince the royalist
  bulk of the bourgeois and landlord class that they might safely leave the
  cares and emoluments of government to the bourgeois
  &ldquo;republicans.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>However, after their one heroic exploit of June, the bourgeois republicans
  had, from the front, to fall back to the rear of the &ldquo;Party of
  Order&rdquo; &ndash; a combination formed by all the rival fractions and
  factions of the appropriating classes. The proper form of their joint-stock
  government was the parliamentary republic, with Louis Bonaparte for its
  president. Theirs was a regime of avowed class terrorism and deliberate
  insult towards the &ldquo;vile multitude.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>If the parliamentary republic, as M. Thiers said, &ldquo;divided them [the
  different fractions of the ruling class] least", it opened an abyss between
  that class and the whole body of society outside their spare ranks. The
  restraints by which their own divisions had under former regimes still
  checked the state power, were removed by their union; and in view of the
  threatening upheaval of the proletariat, they now used that state power
  mercilessly and ostentatiously as the national war engine of capital against
  labor. </p>

  <p>In their uninterrupted crusade against the producing masses, they were,
  however, bound not only to invest the executive with continually increased
  powers of repression, but at the same time to divest their own parliamentary
  stronghold &ndash; the National Assembly &ndash; one by one, of all its own
  means of defence against the Executive. The Executive, in the person of Louis
  Bonaparte, turned them out. The natural offspring of the &ldquo;Party of
  Order&rdquo; republic was the Second Empire. </p>

  <p>The empire, with the coup d&rsquo;etat for its birth certificate,
  universal suffrage for its sanction, and the sword for its sceptre, professed
  to rest upon the peasantry, the large mass of producers not directly involved
  in the struggle of capital and labor. It professed to save the working class
  by breaking down parliamentarism, and, with it, the undisguised subserviency
  of government to the propertied classes. It professed to save the propertied
  classes by upholding their economic supremacy over the working class; and,
  finally, it professed to unite all classes by reviving for all the chimera of
  national glory. </p>

  <p>In reality, it was the only form of government possible at a time when the
  bourgeoisie had already lost, and the working class had not yet acquired, the
  faculty of ruling the nation. It was acclaimed throughout the world as the
  savior of society. Under its sway, bourgeois society, freed from political
  cares, attained a development unexpected even by itself. Its industry and
  commerce expanded to colossal dimensions; financial swindling celebrated
  cosmopolitan orgies; the misery of the masses was set off by a shameless
  display of gorgeous, meretricious and debased luxury. The state power,
  apparently soaring high above society and the very hotbed of all its
  corruptions. Its own rottenness, and the rottenness of the society it had
  saved, were laid bare by the bayonet of Prussia, herself eagerly bent upon
  transferring the supreme seat of that regime from Paris to Berlin.
  Imperialism is, at the same time, the most prostitute and the ultimate form
  of the state power which nascent middle class society had commenced to
  elaborate as a means of its own emancipation from feudalism, and which
  full-grown bourgeois society had finally transformed into a means for the
  enslavement of labor by capital. </p>

  <p>The direct antithesis to the empire was the Commune. The cry of
  &ldquo;social republic,&rdquo; with which the February Revolution was ushered
  in by the Paris proletariat, did but express a vague aspiration after a
  republic that was not only to supercede the monarchical form of class rule,
  but class rule itself. The Commune was the positive form of that republic.
  </p>

  <p>Paris, the central seat of the old governmental power, and, at the same
  time, the social stronghold of the French working class, had risen in arms
  against the attempt of Thiers and the Rurals to restore and perpetuate that
  old governmental power bequeathed to them by the empire. Paris could resist
  only because, in consequence of the siege, it had got rid of the army, and
  replaced it by a National Guard, the bulk of which consisted of working men.
  This fact was now to be transformed into an institution. The first decree of
  the Commune, therefore, was the suppression of the standing army, and the
  substitution for it of the armed people. </p>

  <p>The Commune was formed of the municipal councillors, chosen by universal
  suffrage in the various wards of the town, responsible and revocable at short
  terms. The majority of its members were naturally working men, or
  acknowledged representatives of the working class. The Commune was to be a
  working, not a parliamentary body, executive and legislative at the same
  time. </p>

  <p>Instead of continuing to be the agent of the Central Government, the
  police was at once stripped of its political attributes, and turned into the
  responsible, and at all times revocable, agent of the Commune. So were the
  officials of all other branches of the administration. From the members of
  the Commune downwards, the public service had to be done at
  <em>workman&rsquo;s wage</em>. The vested interests and the representation
  allowances of the high dignitaries of state disappeared along with the high
  dignitaries themselves. Public functions ceased to be the private property of
  the tools of the Central Government. Not only municipal administration, but
  the whole initiative hitherto exercised by the state was laid into the hands
  of the Commune. </p>

  <p>Having once got rid of the standing army and the police &ndash; the
  physical force elements of the old government &ndash; the Commune was anxious
  to break the spiritual force of repression, the &ldquo;parson-power", by the
  disestablishment and disendowment of all churches as proprietary bodies. The
  priests were sent back to the recesses of private life, there to feed upon
  the alms of the faithful in imitation of their predecessors, the apostles.
  </p>

  <p>The whole of the educational institutions were opened to the people
  gratuitously, and at the same time cleared of all interference of church and
  state. Thus, not only was education made accessible to all, but science
  itself freed from the fetters which class prejudice and governmental force
  had imposed upon it. </p>

  <p>The judicial functionaries were to be divested of that sham <a
  name="p221"></a>independence which had but served to mask their abject
  subserviency to all succeeding governments to which, in turn, they had taken,
  and broken, the oaths of allegiance. Like the rest of public servants,
  magistrates and judges were to be elective, responsible, and revocable. </p>

  <p>The Paris Commune was, of course, to serve as a model to all the great
  industrial centres of France. The communal regime once established in Paris
  and the secondary centres, the old centralized government would in the
  provinces, too, have to give way to the self-government of the producers. </p>

  <p>In a rough sketch of national organization, which the Commune had no time
  to develop, it states clearly that the Commune was to be the political form
  of even the smallest country hamlet, and that in the rural districts the
  standing army was to be replaced by a national militia, with an extremely
  short term of service. The rural communities of every district were to
  administer their common affairs by an assembly of delegates in the central
  town, and these district assemblies were again to send deputies to the
  National Delegation in Paris, each delegate to be at any time revocable and
  bound by the <em>mandat imperatif</em> (formal instructions) of his
  constituents. The few but important functions which would still remain for a
  central government were not to be suppressed, as has been intentionally
  misstated, but were to be discharged by Communal and thereafter responsible
  agents. </p>

  <p>The unity of the nation was not to be broken, but, on the contrary, to be
  organized by Communal Constitution, and to become a reality by the
  destruction of the state power which claimed to be the embodiment of that
  unity independent of, and superior to, the nation itself, from which it was
  but a parasitic excresence. </p>

  <p>While the merely repressive organs of the old governmental power were to
  be amputated, its legitimate functions were to be wrested from an authority
  usurping pre-eminence over society itself, and restored to the responsible
  agents of society. <a name="p221-years"></a>Instead of deciding once in three
  or six years which member of the ruling class was to misrepresent the people
  in Parliament, universal suffrage was to serve the people, constituted in
  Communes, as individual suffrage serves every other employer in the search
  for the workmen and managers in his business. And it is well-known that
  companies, like individuals, in matters of real business generally know how
  to put the right man in the right place, and, if they for once make a
  mistake, to redress it promptly. On the other hand, nothing could be more
  foreign to the spirit of the Commune than to supercede universal suffrage by
  hierarchical investiture.<sup class="ednote"><a href="#A"
  name="Ab">[A]</a></sup> </p>

  <p>It is generally the fate of completely new historical creations to be
  mistaken for the counterparts of older, and even defunct, forms of social
  life, to which they may bear a certain likeness. Thus, this new Commune,
  which breaks with the modern state power, has been mistaken for a
  reproduction of the medieval Communes, which first preceded, and afterward
  became the substratum of, that very state power. The Communal Constitution
  has been mistaken for an attempt to break up into the federation of small
  states, as dreamt of by Montesquieu and the Girondins,<sup class="ednote"><a
  href="#B" name="Bb">[B]</a></sup> that unity of great nations which, if
  originally brought about by political force, has now become a powerful
  coefficient of social production. The antagonism of the Commune against the
  state power has been mistaken for an exaggerated form of the ancient struggle
  against over-centralization. Peculiar historical circumstances may have
  prevented the classical development, as in France, of the bourgeois form of
  government, and may have allowed, as in England, to complete the great
  central state organs by corrupt vestries, jobbing councillors, and ferocious
  poor-law guardians in the towns, and virtually hereditary magistrates in the
  counties. </p>

  <p>The Communal Constitution would have restored to the social body all the
  forces hitherto absorbed by the state parasite feeding upon, and clogging the
  free movement of, society. By this one act, it would have initiated the
  regeneration of France. </p>

  <p>The provincial French middle class saw in the Commune an attempt to
  restore the sway their order had held over the country under Louis Philippe,
  and which, under Louis Napoleon, was supplanted by the pretended rule of the
  country over the towns. In reality, the Communal Constitution brought the
  rural producers under the intellectual lead of the central towns of their
  districts, and there secured to them, in the working men, the natural
  trustees of their interests. The very existence of the Commune involved, as a
  matter of course, local municipal liberty, but no longer as a check upon the
  now superseded state power. It could only enter into the head of a Bismarck
  &ndash; who, when not engaged on his intrigues of blood and iron, always
  likes to resume his old trade, so befitting his mental calibre, of
  contributor to <em>Kladderadatsch</em> (the Berlin <em>Punch</em>)<sup
  class="ednote"><a href="#C" name="Cb">[C]</a></sup> &ndash; it could only
  enter into such a head to ascribe to the Paris Commune aspirations after the
  caricature of the old French municipal organization of 1791, the Prussian
  municipal constitution which degrades the town governments to mere secondary
  wheels in the police machinery of the Prussian state. The Commune made that
  catchword of bourgeois revolutions &ndash; cheap government &ndash; a reality
  by destroying the two greatest sources of expenditure: the standing army and
  state functionarism. Its very existence presupposed the non-existence of
  monarchy, which, in Europe at least, is the normal incumbrance and
  indispensable cloak of class rule. It supplied the republic with the basis of
  really democratic institutions. But neither cheap government nor the
  &ldquo;true republic&rdquo; was its ultimate aim; they were its mere
  concomitants. </p>

  <p>The multiplicity of interpretations to which the Commune has been
  subjected, and the multiplicity of interests which construed it in their
  favor, show that it was a thoroughly expansive political form, while all the
  previous forms of government had been emphatically repressive. Its true
  secret was this: </p>

  <p class="quoteb">It was essentially a working class government, the product
  of the struggle of the producing against the appropriating class, the
  political form at last discovered under which to work out the economical
  emancipation of labor. </p>

  <p>Except on this last condition, the Communal Constitution would have been
  an impossibility and a delusion. The political rule of the producer cannot
  co-exist with the perpetuation of his social slavery. The Commune was
  therefore to serve as a lever for uprooting the economical foundation upon
  which rests the existence of classes, and therefore of class rule. With labor
  emancipated, every man becomes a working man, and productive labor ceases to
  be a class attribute. </p>

  <p>It is a strange fact. In spite of all the tall talk and all the immense
  literature, for the last 60 years, about emancipation of labor, no sooner do
  the working men anywhere take the subject into their own hands with a will,
  than uprises at once all the apologetic phraseology of the mouthpieces of
  present society with its two poles of capital and wages-slavery (the landlord
  now is but the sleeping partner of the capitalist), as if the capitalist
  society was still in its purest state of virgin innocence, with its
  antagonisms still undeveloped, with its delusions still unexploded, with its
  prostitute realities not yet laid bare. The Commune, they exclaim, intends to
  abolish property, the basis of all civilization! </p>

  <p>Yes, gentlemen, the Commune intended to abolish that class property which
  makes the labor of the many the wealth of the few. It aimed at the
  expropriation of the expropriators. It wanted to make individual property a
  truth by transforming the means of production, land, and capital, now chiefly
  the means of enslaving and exploiting labor, into mere instruments of free
  and associated labor. But this is communism, &ldquo;impossible&rdquo;
  communism! Why, those members of the ruling classes who are intelligent
  enough to perceive the impossibility of continuing the present system &ndash;
  and they are many &ndash; have become the obtrusive and full-mouthed apostles
  of co-operative production. If co-operative production is not to remain a
  sham and a snare; if it is to supersede the capitalist system; if united
  co-operative societies are to regulate national production upon common plan,
  thus taking it under their own control, and putting an end to the constant
  anarchy and periodical convulsions which are the fatality of capitalist
  production &ndash; what else, gentlemen, would it be but communism,
  &ldquo;possible&rdquo; communism? </p>

  <p>The working class did not expect miracles from the Commune. They have no
  ready-made utopias to introduce <em>par décret du peuple</em>. They know that
  in order to work out their own emancipation, and along with it that higher
  form to which present society is irresistably tending by its own economical
  agencies, they will have to pass through long struggles, through a series of
  historic processes, transforming circumstances and men. They have no ideals
  to realize, but to set free the elements of the new society with which old
  collapsing bourgeois society itself is pregnant. In the full consciousness of
  their historic mission, and with the heroic resolve to act up to it, the
  working class can afford to smile at the coarse invective of the
  gentlemen&rsquo;s gentlemen with pen and inkhorn, and at the didactic
  patronage of well-wishing bourgeois-doctrinaires, pouring forth their
  ignorant platitudes and sectarian crotchets in the oracular tone of
  scientific infallibility. </p>

  <p>When the Paris Commune took the management of the revolution in its own
  hands; when plain working men for the first time dared to infringe upon the
  governmental privilege of their &ldquo;natural superiors,&rdquo; and, under
  circumstances of unexampled difficulty, performed it at salaries the highest
  of which barely amounted to one-fifth of what, according to high scientific
  authority,<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">(1)</a></sup> is the
  minimum required for a secretary to a certain metropolitan school-board
  &ndash; the old world writhed in convulsions of rage at the sight of the Red
  Flag, the symbol of the Republic of Labor, floating over the Hôtel de Ville.
  </p>

  <p>And yet, this was the first revolution in which the working class was
  openly acknowledged as the only class capable of social initiative, even by
  the great bulk of the Paris middle class &ndash; shopkeepers, tradesmen,
  merchants &ndash; the wealthy capitalist alone excepted. The Commune had
  saved them by a sagacious settlement of that ever recurring cause of dispute
  among the middle class themselves &ndash; the debtor and creditor
  accounts.<sup class="ednote"><a href="#D" name="Db">[D]</a></sup> The same
  portion of the middle class, after they had assisted in putting down the
  working men&rsquo;s insurrection of June 1848, had been at once
  unceremoniously sacrificed to their creditors<sup class="ednote"><a href="#E"
  name="Eb">[E]</a></sup> by the then Constituent Assembly. But this was not
  their only motive for now rallying around the working class. They felt there
  was but one alternative &ndash; the Commune, or the empire &ndash; under
  whatever name it might reappear. The empire had ruined them economically by
  the havoc it made of public wealth, by the wholesale financial swindling it
  fostered, by the props it lent to the artificially accelerated centralization
  of capital, and the concomitant expropriation of their own ranks. It had
  suppressed them politically, it had shocked them morally by its orgies, it
  had insulted their Voltairianism by handing over the education of their
  children to the <em>fréres Ignorantins</em>,<sup class="ednote"><a href="#F"
  name="Fb">[F]</a></sup> it had revolted their national feeling as Frenchmen
  by precipitating them headlong into a war which left only one equivalent for
  the ruins it made &ndash; the disappearance of the empire. In fact, after the
  exodus from Paris of the high Bonapartist and capitalist <em>bohème</em>, the
  true middle class Party of Order came out in the shape of the &ldquo;Union
  Republicaine,&rdquo;<sup class="ednote"><a href="#G" name="Gb">[G]</a></sup>
  enrolling themselves under the colors of the Commune and defending it against
  the wilful misconstructions of Thiers. Whether the gratitude of this great
  body of the middle class will stand the present severe trial, time must show.
  </p>

  <p>The Commune was perfectly right in telling the peasants that &ldquo;its
  victory was their only hope.&rdquo; Of all the lies hatched at Versailles and
  re-echoed by the glorious European penny-a-liner, one of the most tremendous
  was that the Rurals represented the French peasantry. Think only of the love
  of the French peasant for the men to whom, after 1815, he had to pay the
  milliard indemnity.<sup class="ednote"><a href="#H" name="Hb">[H]</a></sup>
  In the eyes of the French peasant, the very existence of a great landed
  proprietor is in itself an encroachment on his conquests of 1789. The
  bourgeois, in 1848, had burdened his plot of land with the additional tax of
  45 cents in the franc; but then he did so in the name of the revolution;
  while now he had fomented a civil war against revolution, to shift on to the
  peasant&rsquo;s shoulders the chief load of the 5 milliards of indemnity to
  be paid to the Prussian. The Commune, on the other hand, in one of its first
  proclamations, declared that the true originators of the war would be made to
  pay its cost. The Commune would have delivered the peasant of the blood tax
  &ndash; would have given him a cheap government &ndash; transformed his
  present blood-suckers, the notary, advocate, executor, and other judicial
  vampires, into salaried communal agents, elected by, and responsible to,
  himself. It would have freed him of the tyranny of the <em>garde
  champêtre</em>, the gendarme, and the prefect; would have put enlightenment
  by the schoolmaster in the place of stultification by the priest. And the
  French peasant is, above all, a man of reckoning. He would find it extremely
  reasonable that the pay of the priest, instead of being extorted by the
  tax-gatherer, should only depend upon the spontaneous action of the
  parishioners&rsquo; religious instinct. Such were the great immediate boons
  which the rule of the Commune &ndash; and that rule alone &ndash; held out to
  the French peasantry. It is, therefore, quite superfluous here to expatiate
  upon the more complicated but vital problems which the Commune alone was
  able, and at the same time compelled, to solve in favor of the peasant
  &ndash; viz., the hypothecary debt, lying like an incubus upon his parcel of
  soil, the <em>prolétariat foncier</em> (the rural proletariat), daily growing
  upon it, and his expropriation from it enforced, at a more and more rapid
  rate, by the very development of modern agriculture and the competition of
  capitalist farming. </p>

  <p>The French peasant had elected Louis Bonaparte president of the Republic;
  but the Party of Order created the empire. What the French peasant really
  wants he commenced to show in 1849 and 1850, by opposing his <em>maire</em>
  to the government&rsquo;s prefect, his school-master to the
  government&rsquo;s priest, and himself to the government&rsquo;s gendarme.
  All the laws made by the Party of Order in January and February 1850 were
  avowed measures of repression against the peasant. The peasant was a
  Bonapartist, because the Great Revolution, with all its benefits to him, was,
  in his eyes, personified in Napoleon. This delusion, rapidly breaking down
  under the Second Empire (and in its very nature hostile to the Rurals), this
  prejudice of the past, how could it have withstood the appeal of the Commune
  to the living interests and urgent wants of the peasantry? </p>

  <p>The Rurals &ndash; this was, in fact, their chief apprehension &ndash;
  knew that three months&rsquo; free communication of Communal Paris with the
  provinces would bring about a general rising of the peasants, and hence their
  anxiety to establish a police blockade around Paris, so as to stop the spread
  of the rinderpest <span class="context">[cattle pest &ndash; contagious
  disease].</span> </p>

  <p>If the Commune was thus the true representative of all the healthy
  elements of French society, and therefore the truly national government, it
  was, at the same time, as a working men&rsquo;s government, as the bold
  champion of the emancipation of labor, emphatically international. Within
  sight of that Prussian army, that had annexed to Germany two French
  provinces, the Commune annexed to France the working people all over the
  world. </p>

  <p>The Second Empire had been the jubilee of cosmopolitan blackleggism, the
  rakes of all countries rushing in at its call for a share in its orgies and
  in the plunder of the French people. Even at this moment, the right hand of
  Thiers is Ganessco, the foul Wallachian, and his left hand is Markovsky, the
  Russian spy. The Commune admitted all foreigners to the honor of dying for an
  immortal cause. Between the foreign war lost by their treason, and the civil
  war fomented by their conspiracy with the foreign invader, the bourgeoisie
  had found the time to display their patriotism by organizing police hunts
  upon the Germans in France. The Commune made a German working man [Leo
  Frankel] its Minister of Labor. Thiers, the bourgeoisie, the Second Empire,
  had continually deluded Poland by loud professions of sympathy, while in
  reality betraying her to, and doing the dirty work of, Russia. The Commune
  honored the heroic sons of Poland [J. Dabrowski and W. Wróblewski] by placing
  them at the head of the defenders of Paris. And, to broadly mark the new era
  of history it was conscious of initiating, under the eyes of the conquering
  Prussians on one side, and the Bonapartist army, led by Bonapartist generals,
  on the other, the Commune pulled down that colossal symbol of martial glory,
  the Vendôme Column.<sup class="ednote"><a href="#I" name="Ib">[I]</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p>The great social measure of the Commune was its own working existence. Its
  special measures could but betoken the tendency of a government of the people
  by the people. Such were the abolition of the nightwork of journeymen bakers;
  the prohibition, under penalty, of the employers&rsquo; practice to reduce
  wages by levying upon their workpeople fines under manifold pretexts &ndash;
  a process in which the employer combines in his own person the parts of
  legislator, judge, and executor, and filches the money to boot. Another
  measure of this class was the surrender to associations of workmen, under
  reserve of compensation, of all closed workshops and factories, no matter
  whether the respective capitalists had absconded or preferred to strike work.
  </p>

  <p>The financial measures of the Commune, remarkable for their sagacity and
  moderation, could only be such as were compatible with the state of a
  besieged town. Considering the colossal robberies committed upon the city of
  Paris by the great financial companies and contractors, under the protection
  of Haussman,<sup class="ednote"><a href="#J" name="Jb">[J]</a></sup> the
  Commune would have had an incomparably better title to confiscate their
  property than Louis Napoleon had against the Orleans family. The Hohenzollern
  and the English oligarchs, who both have derived a good deal of their estates
  from church plunders, were, of course, greatly shocked at the Commune
  clearing but 8,000F out of secularization. </p>

  <p>While the Versailles government, as soon as it had recovered some spirit
  and strength, used the most violent means against the Commune; while it put
  down the free expression of opinion all over France, even to the forbidding
  of meetings of delegates from the large towns; while it subjected Versailles
  and the rest of France to an espionage far surpassing that of the Second
  Empire; while it burned by its gendarme inquisitors all papers printed at
  Paris, and sifted all correspondence from and to Paris; while in the National
  Assembly the most timid attempts to put in a word for Paris were howled down
  in a manner unknown even to the <em>Chambre introuvable</em> of 1816; with
  the savage warfare of Versailles outside, and its attempts at corruption and
  conspiracy inside Paris &ndash; would the Commune not have shamefully
  betrayed its trust by affecting to keep all the decencies and appearances of
  liberalism as in a time of profound peace? Had the government of the Commune
  been akin to that of M. Thiers, there would have been no more occasion to
  suppress Party of Order papers at Paris that there was to suppress Communal
  papers at Versailles. </p>

  <p>It was irritating indeed to the Rurals that at the very same time they
  declared the return to the church to be the only means of salvation for
  France, the infidel Commune unearthed the peculiar mysteries of the Picpus
  nunnery, and of the Church of St. Laurent.<sup class="ednote"><a href="#K"
  name="Kb">[K]</a></sup> It was a satire upon M. Thiers that, while he
  showered grand crosses upon the Bonapartist generals in acknowledgment of
  their mastery in losing battles, signing capitulations, and turning
  cigarettes at Wilhelmshöhe,<sup class="ednote"><a href="#L"
  name="Lb">[L]</a></sup> the Commune dismissed and arrested its generals
  whenever they were suspected of neglecting their duties. The expulsion from,
  and arrest by, the Commune of one of its members [Blanchet] who had slipped
  in under a false name, and had undergone at Lyons six days&rsquo;
  imprisonment for simple bankruptcy, was it not a deliberate insult hurled at
  the forger, Jules Favre, then still the foreign minister of France, still
  selling France to Bismarck, and still dictating his orders to that paragon
  government of Belgium? But indeed the Commune did not pretend to
  infallibility, the invariable attribute of all governments of the old stamp.
  It published its doings and sayings, it initiated the public into all its
  shortcomings. </p>

  <p>In every revolution there intrude, at the side of its true agents, men of
  different stamp; some of them survivors of and devotees to past revolutions,
  without insight into the present movement, but preserving popular influence
  by their known honesty and courage, or by the sheer force of tradition;
  others mere brawlers who, by dint of repeating year after year the same set
  of stereotyped declarations against the government of the day, have sneaked
  into the reputation of revolutionists of the first water. After March 18,
  some such men did also turn up, and in some cases contrived to play
  pre-eminent parts. As far as their power went, they hampered the real action
  of the working class, exactly as men of that sort have hampered the full
  development of every previous revolution. They are an unavoidable evil: with
  time they are shaken off; but time was not allowed to the Commune. </p>

  <p>Wonderful, indeed, was the change the Commune had wrought in Paris! No
  longer any trace of the meretricious Paris of the Second Empire! No longer
  was Paris the rendezvous of British landlords, Irish absentees,<sup
  class="ednote"><a href="#M" name="Mb">[M]</a></sup> American ex-slaveholders
  and shoddy men, Russian ex-serfowners, and Wallachian boyards. No more
  corpses at the morgue, no nocturnal burglaries, scarcely any robberies; in
  fact, for the first time since the days of February 1848, the streets of
  Paris were safe, and that without any police of any kind. </p>

  <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;We,&rdquo; said a member of the Commune, &ldquo;hear
  no longer of assassination, theft, and personal assault; it seems indeed as
  if the police had dragged along with it to Versailles all its Conservative
  friends.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>The <em>cocottes</em> <span class="context">[&lsquo;chickens&rsquo; &ndash; prostitutes]</span> had refound the scent of their protectors &ndash;
  the absconding men of family, religion, and, above all, of property. In their
  stead, the real women of Paris showed again at the surface &ndash; heroic,
  noble, and devoted, like the women of antiquity. Working, thinking fighting,
  bleeding Paris &ndash; almost forgetful, in its incubation of a new society,
  of the Cannibals at its gates &ndash; radiant in the enthusiasm of its
  historic initiative! </p>

  <p>Opposed to this new world at Paris, behold the old world at Versailles
  &ndash; that assembly of the ghouls of all defunct regimes, Legitimists and
  Orleanists, eager to feed upon the carcass of the nation &ndash; with a tail
  of antediluvian republicans, sanctioning, by their presence in the Assembly,
  the slaveholders&rsquo; rebellion, relying for the maintenance of their
  parliamentary republic upon the vanity of the senile mountebank at its head,
  and caricaturing 1789 by holding their ghastly meetings in the <em>Jeu de
  Paume</em>.<sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">(2)</a></sup> There it
  was, this Assembly, the representative of everything dead in France, propped
  up to the semblance of life by nothing but the swords of the generals of
  Louis Bonaparte. Paris all truth, Versailles all lie; and that lie vented
  through the mouth of Thiers. </p>

  <p>Thiers tells a deputation of the mayors of the Seine-et-Oise &ndash;
  &ldquo;You may rely upon my word, which I have never broken!&rdquo; </p>

  <p>He tells the Assembly itself that &ldquo;it was the most freely elected
  and most liberal Assembly France ever possessed"; he tells his motley
  soldiery that it was &ldquo;the admiration of the world, and the finest army
  France ever possessed&rdquo;; he tells the provinces that the bombardment of Paris
  by him was a myth: &ldquo;If some cannon-shots have been fired, it was not
  the deed of the army of Versailles, but of some insurgents trying to make
  believe that they are fighting, while they dare not show their faces.&rdquo;
  He again tells the provinces that &ldquo;the artillery of Versailles does not
  bombard Paris, but only cannonades it". He tells the Archbishop of Paris that
  the pretended executions and reprisals (!) attributed to the Versailles
  troops were all moonshine. He tells Paris that he was only anxious &ldquo;to
  free it from the hideous tyrants who oppress it,&rdquo; and that, in fact,
  the Paris of the Commune was &ldquo;but a handful of criminals.&rdquo; </p>

  <p>The Paris of M. Thiers was not the real Paris of the &ldquo;vile
  multitude,&rdquo; but a phantom Paris, the Paris of the
  <em>francs-fileurs</em>,<sup class="ednote"><a href="#N"
  name="Nb">[N]</a></sup> the Paris of the Boulevards, male and female &ndash;
  the rich, the capitalist, the gilded, the idle Paris, now thronging with its
  lackeys, its blacklegs, its literary <em>bonhome</em>, and its
  <em>cocottes</em> at Versailles, Saint-Denis, Rueil, and Saint-Germain;
  considering the civil war but an agreeable diversion, eyeing the battle going
  on through telescopes, counting the rounds of cannon, swearing by their own
  honor and that of their prostitutes, that the performance was far better got
  up than it used to be at the Porte St. Martin. The men who fell were really
  dead; the cries of the wounded were cries in good earnest; and, besides, the
  whole thing was so intensely historical. </p>

  <p>This is the Paris of M. Thiers, as the emigration of Coblenz was the
  France of M. de Calonne.<sup class="ednote"><a href="#O"
