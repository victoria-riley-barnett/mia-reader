  &#8220;The column of prisoners halted in the Avenue Uhrich, and was drawn
  up, four or five deep, on the footway facing to the road.  General
  Marquis de Gallifet and his staff dismounted and commenced an
  inspection from the left of the line.  Walking down slowly and eyeing
  the ranks, the general stopped here and there, tapping a man on the
  shoulder or beckoning him out of the rear ranks.  In most cases,
  without further parley, the individual thus selected was marched out
  into the centre of the road, where a small supplementary column was
  thus soon formed.... A mounted officer pointed out to General Gallifet a man
  and woman for some particular offence.  The women, rushing out of the
  ranks, threw herself on her knees, and, with outstretched arms,
  protested her innocence in passionate terms.  The general waited for a
  pause, and then with most impassible face and unmoved demeanor, said:
  &#8217;Madame, I have visited every theatre in Paris, your acting will have
  no effect on me.&#8217; (ce n&#8217;est pas la peine de jouer la comedie)....  It
  was not a good thing on that day to be noticeably taller, dirtier,
  cleaner, older, uglier than one&#8217;s neighbors.  One individual in
  particular struck me as probably owing his speedy release from the
  ills of this world to his having a broken nose....  Over a hundred
  being thus chosen, a firing party told off, and the column resumed its
  march, leaving them behind.  A few minutes afterwards a dropping fire
  in our rear commenced, and continued for over a quarter of an hour. 
  It was the execution of the summarily-convicted wretches.&#8221; (Paris Correspondent, <em>Daily News</em>, June 8.)

This Gallifet, &#8220;the kept man of his wife, so notorious for her shameless
exhibitions at the orgies of the Second Empire,&#8221; went, during the war,
by the name of the French &#8220;<i>Ensign Pistol</i>.&#8221; </p>

  &#8220;The <em>Temps</em>, which is a careful journal, and not given to sensation,
  tells a dreadful story of people imperfectly shot and buried before
  life was extinct.  A great number were buried in the Square round St. 
  Jacques-la-Bouchiere; some of them very superficially.  In the daytime
  the roar of the busy streets prevented any notice being taken; but in
  the stillness of the night the inhabitants of the houses in the
  neighborhood were roused by distant moans, and in the morning a
  clenched hand was seen protruding through the soil.  In consequence of
  this, exhumations were ordered to take place....  that many wounded
  have been buried alive I have not the slightest doubt.  One case I can
  vouch for.  When Brunel was shot with his mistress on the 24th ult. 
  in the courtyard of a house in the place Vendome, the bodies lay there
  until the afternoon of the 27th.  When the burial party came to remove
  the corpses, they found the woman still living, and took her to an
  ambulance.  Though she had received four bullets she is now out of
  danger.&#8221; (Paris Correspondent, <em>Evening Standard</em>, June 8.) </p>

The following letter appeared in the [London] <em>Times</em>, June 13:
</p>
<p class="indentb">
     &#8220;To the editor of <em>The Times</em>:</p>
<p class="indentb">
     &#8220;Sir.  &#8211; On June 6, 1871, M.  Jules Favre issued a circular to
     all the European Powers, calling them to hunt down the
     International Working Men&#8217;s Association.  A few remarks will
     suffice to characterize that document.</p>
<p class="indentb">
     &#8220;In the very preamble to our statutes it is stated that the
     International was found &#8220;September 28, 1864, at a public meeting
     held at St. Martin&#8217;s Hall, Long Acre, London".  For purposes of
     his own Jules Favre puts back the date of its origin behind 1862.</p>
<p class="indentb">
     &#8220;In order to explain our principles, he professes to quote &#8220;their
     (the International&#8217;s) sheet of the 25th of March, 1869".  And then
     what does he quote? The sheet of a society which is not the
     International.  This sort of maneuvre he already recurred to when,
     still a comparatively young lawyer, he had to defend the <em>National</em>
     newspaper, prosecuted for libel by Cabet. 
	 Then he pretended to read extracts from Cabet&#8217;s pamphlets while reading interpolations
     of his own &#8211; a trick exposed while the court was sitting, and
     which, but for the indulgence of Cabet, would have been punished by
     Jules Favre&#8217;s expulsion for the Paris bar.  Of all the documents
     quoted by him as documents of the International, not one belongs to
     the International. </p>
<p class="indentb">
      He says, for instance,</p>
<p class="quoteb">
     &#8220;The Alliance declared
     itself Atheist, says the General Council, constituted in London in
     July 1869.&#8221; </p>
<p class="indentb">
     &#8220;The General Council never issued such a document.  On
     the contrary, it issued a document which quashed the original
     statutes of the &#8217;Alliance&#8217; &#8211; L&#8217;Alliance de la D&eacute;mocratie
     Socialiste at Geneva &#8211; quoted by Jules favre. </p>
<p class="indentb">
     &#8220;Throughout his circular, which pretends in part also to be directed
     against the Empire, Jules Favre repeats against the International
     but the police inventions of the public prosecutors of the Empire,
     which broke down miserably even before the laws courts of that
     Empire. </p>
<p class="indentb">
     &#8220;It is known that in its two Addresses (of <a href="ch01.htm">July</a> and <a href="ch02.htm">September</a> last)
     on the late war, the General Council of the International denounced
     the Prussian plans of conquest against France.  Later on, Mr. 
     Reitlinger, Jules Favre&#8217;s private secretary, applied, though of
     course in vain, to some members of the General Council for getting
     up by the Council a demonstration against Bismarck, in favor of the
     Government of National Defence; they were particularly requested
     not to mention the republic.  The preparations for a demonstration
     with regard to the expected arrival of Jules Favre in London were
     made &#8211; certainly with the best of intentions &#8211; in spite of the
     General Council, which, in its address of the 9th of September, had
     distinctly forewarned the Paris workmen against Jules Favre and his
     colleagues. </p>
<p class="indentb">
     &#8220;What would Jules Favre say if, in its turn, the International were
     to send a circular on Jules Favre to all the Cabinets of Europe,
     drawing their particular attention to the document published at
     Paris by the late M. Milliere?</p>
<p class="indentb">
     I am, Sir, your obedient servant,<br />
     <i>John Hales</i>,<br />
	 Secretary to the General Council of the International
     Working Men&#8217;s Association </p>
<p class="indentb">
     London </p>
<p class="indentb">
 June 12th, 1871</p>

<p>In an article on &#8220;The International Society and its aims,&#8221; that pious informer, the <em>London Spectator </em>(June 24th), amongst other similar tricks, quotes, <em>even more </em>fully than Jules Favre has done, the above document of the &#8220;Alliance&#8221; as the work of the International, and that <em>eleven days </em>after the refutation had been published in <em>The Times. </em>We do not wonder at this. Frederick the Great used to say that of all Jesuits the worst are the Protestant ones.</p>
