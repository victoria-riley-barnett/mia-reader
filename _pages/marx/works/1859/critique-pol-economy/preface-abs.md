> [ The first work which I undertook to dispel the doubts assailing me
> was a critical re-examination of the Hegelian philosophy of law; the
> introduction to this work being published in the *Deutsch-Franzosische
> Jahrbucher* issued in Paris in 1844. My inquiry led me to the
> conclusion that neither legal relations nor political forms could be
> comprehended whether by themselves or on the basis of a so-called
> general development of the human mind, but that on the contrary they
> originate in the material conditions of life, the totality of which
> Hegel, following the example of English and French thinkers of the
> eighteenth century, embraces within the term \"civil society\"; that
> the anatomy of this civil society, however, has to be sought in
> political economy. The study of this, which I began in Paris, I
> continued in Brussels, where I moved owing to an expulsion order
> issued by M. Guizot. The general conclusion at which I arrived and
> which, once reached, became the guiding principle of my studies, can
> be summarised as follows.]{.context} 
>
> In the social
> [production](../../../../../glossary/terms/p/r.htm#production) of
> their life, men enter into definite relations that are indispensable
> and independent of their will, [relations of
> production](../../../../../glossary/terms/r/e.htm#relations-production)
> which correspond to a definite stage of development of their material
> [productive
> forces](../../../../../glossary/terms/p/r.htm#productive-forces). The
> sum total of these relations of production constitutes the economic
> structure of society, the real foundation, on which rises a legal and
> political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of
> social consciousness.
>
> The [mode of
> production](../../../../../glossary/terms/m/o.htm#mode-production) of
> material life conditions the social, political and intellectual life
> process in general. It is not the
> [consciousness](../../../../../glossary/terms/c/o.htm#consciousness)
> of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social
> being that determines their consciousness.
>
> At a certain stage of their development, the material productive
> forces of society come in conflict with the existing relations of
> production, or --- what is but a legal expression for the same thing
> --- with the
> [property](../../../../../glossary/terms/p/r.htm#property) relations
> within which they have been at work hitherto. From forms of
> development of the productive forces these relations turn into their
> fetters.
>
> Then begins an epoch of social revolution. With the change of the
> economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is more or less
> rapidly transformed. In considering such transformations a distinction
> should always be made between the material transformation of the
> economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the
> precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious,
> aesthetic or philosophic --- in short, ideological forms in which men
> become conscious of this conflict and fight it out. Just as our
> opinion of an individual is not based on what he thinks of himself, so
> can we not judge of such a period of transformation by its own
> consciousness; on the contrary, this consciousness must be explained
> rather from the contradictions of material life, from the existing
> conflict between the social productive forces and the relations of
> production.
>
> No social order ever perishes before all the productive forces for
> which there is room in it have developed; and new, higher relations of
> production never appear before the material conditions of their
> existence have matured in the womb of the old society itself.
> Therefore mankind always sets itself only such tasks as it can solve;
> since, looking at the matter more closely, it will always be found
> that the tasks itself arises only when the material conditions of its
> solution already exist or are at least in the process of formation.
>
> In broad outlines Asiatic^[\[A\]](#e1){#eb1}^, ancient, feudal, and
> modern bourgeois modes of production can be designated as progressive
> epochs in the economic formation of society. The bourgeois relations
> of production are the last antagonistic form of the social process of
> production --- antagonistic not in the sense of individual
> antagonisms, but of one arising from the social conditions of life of
> the individuals; at the same time the productive forces developing in
> the womb of bourgeois society create the material conditions for the
> solution of that antagonism. This social formation brings, therefore,
> the prehistory of society to a close.

> [ Frederick Engels, with whom I maintained a constant exchange of
> ideas by correspondence since the publication of his brilliant essay
> on the critique of economic categories (printed in the
> *Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher,* arrived by another road (compare
> his *Lage der arbeitenden Klasse in England* ) at the same result as
> I, and when in the spring of 1845 he too came to live in Brussels, we
> decided to set forth together our conception as opposed to the
> ideological one of German philosophy, in fact to settle accounts with
> our former philosophical conscience. The intention was carried out in
> the form of a critique of post-Hegelian philosophy. The manuscript
> \[The German Ideology\], two large octavo volumes, had long ago
> reached the publishers in Westphalia when we were informed that owing
> to changed circumstances it could not be printed. We abandoned the
> manuscript to the gnawing criticism of the mice all the more willingly
> since we had achieved our main purpose ---
> self-clarification\....]{.context}

> [[A.](#eb1){#e1}]{.info} As a second footnote to the Communist
> Manifesto, Engels wrote in 1888:
>
> In 1847, the pre-history of society, the social organization existing
> previous to recorded history, \[was\] all but unknown. Since then,
> August von Haxthausen (1792-1866) discovered common ownership of land
> in Russia, Georg Ludwig von Maurer proved it to be the social
> foundation from which all Teutonic races started in history, and, by
> and by, village communities were found to be, or to have been, the
> primitive form of society everywhere from India to Ireland. The inner
> organization of this primitive communistic society was laid bare, in
> its typical form, by Lewis Henry Morgan\'s (1818-1861) crowning
> discovery of the true nature of the gens and its relation to the
> tribe. With the dissolution of the primeval communities, society
> begins to be differentiated into separate and finally antagonistic
> classes. I have attempted to retrace this dissolution in [The Origin
> of the Family, Private Property, and the
> State](../../1884/origin-family/index.htm), second edition, Stuttgart,
> 1886.
>
> Thus, as the science of understanding pre-history progressed
> (pre-history being that time before written records of human
> civilization exist), Marx & Engels changed their understanding and
> descriptions accordingly. In the above text, Marx mentions "Asiatic"
> modes of production. At the time, they had thought Asian civilization
> was the first we could speak of humanity (an understanding based on
> Hegel, see: [The Oriental
> Realm](../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate.htm#PR341)).
> After writing [*The Grundrisse*](../../1857/grundrisse/ch09.htm), they
> dropped the idea of a distinct Asiatic mode of production, and kept
> four basic forms: tribal, ancient, feudal, and capitalist.
