## Paul Lafargue

# The Right To Be Lazy

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

### Preface

M. Thiers, at a private session of the commission on primary education
of 1849, said: "I wish to make the influence of the clergy all powerful
because I count upon it to propagate that good philosophy which teaches
man that he is here below to suffer, and not that other philosophy which
on the contrary bids man to enjoy." M. Thiers was stating the ethics of
the capitalist class, whose fierce egoism and narrow intelligence he
incarnated.

The Bourgeoisie, when it was struggling against the nobility sustained
by the clergy, hoisted the flag of free thought and atheism; but once
triumphant, it changed its tone and manner and today it uses religion to
support its economic and political supremacy. In the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries, it had joyfully taken up the pagan tradition and
glorified the flesh and its passions, reproved by Christianity; in our
days, gorged with goods and with pleasures, it denies the teachings of
its thinkers like Rabelais and Diderot, and preaches abstinence to the
wageworkers. Capitalist ethics, a pitiful parody on Christian ethics,
strikes with its anathema the flesh of the laborer; its ideal is to
reduce the producer to the smallest number of needs, to suppress his
joys and his passions and to condemn him to play the part of a machine
turning out work without respite and without thanks.

The revolutionary socialists must take up again the battle fought by the
philosophers and pamphleteers of the bourgeoisie; they must march up to
the assault of the ethics and the social theories of capitalism; they
must demolish in the heads of the class which they call to action the
prejudices sown in them by the ruling class; they must proclaim in the
faces of the hypocrites of all ethical systems that the earth shall
cease to be the vale of tears for the laborer; that in the communist
society of the future, which we shall establish "peaceably if we may,
forcibly if we must," the impulses of men will be given a free rein, for
"all these impulses are by nature good, we have nothing to avoid but
their misuse and their excesses," and they will not be avoided except by
their mutual counter-balancing, by the harmonious development of the
human organism, for as Dr. Beddoe says, "It is only when a race reaches
its maximum of physical development, that it arrives at its highest
point of energy and moral vigor." Such was also the opinion of the great
naturalist Charles Darwin.

This refutation of the "Right to Work" which I am republishing with some
additional notes appeared in the weekly **Egalité**, 1880, second
series.
