> (1841-1911), Karl Marx's son-in-law, was a leading member of the
> French socialist movement and played an important rôle in the
> development of the Spanish socialist movement. A close friend of
> Friedrich Engels in his later years, he wrote and spoke from a fairly
> orthodox Marxist perspective on a wide-range of topics including
> women's rights, anthropology, ethnology, reformism, Millerandism, and
> economics. For comments contact [Einde
