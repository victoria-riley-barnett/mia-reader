> "Marxism, signifies neither more nor less than the destruction of
> capitalism. Even as a scientific discipline it offers nothing to the
> bourgeoisie. And yet, as an alternative to the discredited bourgeois
> social theory, it may serve the latter by providing it with some ideas
> useful for its rejuvenation." [Marxism: Yesterday, Today, and
> Tomorrow](1978/marxism.htm)
