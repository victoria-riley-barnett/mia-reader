> #### A Militant Celebration
>
> Women's Day or Working Women's Day is a day of international
> solidarity, and a day for reviewing the strength and organization of
> proletarian women.
>
> But this is not a special day for women alone. The 8th of March is a
> historic and memorable day for the workers and peasants, for all the
> Russian workers and for the workers of the whole world. In 1917, on
> this day, the great February revolution broke out.^[\[2\]](#n2)^ It
> was the working women of Petersburg who began this revolution; it was
> they who first decided to raise the banner of opposition to the Tsar
> and his associates. And so, working women's day is a double
> celebration for us.
>
> But if this is a general holiday for all the proletariat, why do we
> call it "Women's Day\"? Why then do we hold special celebrations and
> meetings aimed above all at the women workers and the peasant women?
> Doesn't this jeopardize the unity and solidarity of the working class?
> To answer these questions, we have to look back and see how Women's
> Day came about and for what purpose it was organized.
>
> ### How and Why was Women's Day Organised?
>
> Not very long ago, in fact about ten years ago, the question of
> women's equality, and the question of whether women could take part in
> government alongside men was being hotly debated. The working class in
> all capitalist countries struggled for the rights of working women:
> the bourgeoisie did not want to accept these rights. It was not in the
> interest of the bourgeoisie to strengthen the vote of the working
> class in parliament; and in every country they hindered the passing of
> laws that gave the right to working women.
>
> Socialists in North America insisted upon their demands for the vote
> with particular persistence. On the 28th of February, 1909, the women
> socialists of the U.S.A. organized huge demonstrations and meetings
> all over the country demanding political rights for working women.
> This was the first "Woman's Day\". The initiative on organizing a
> woman's day thus belongs to the working women of America.
>
> In 1910, at the Second International Conference of Working Women,
> Clara Zetkin ^[\[3\]](#n3)^ brought forward the question of organizing
> an International Working Women's Day. The conference decided that
> every year, in every country, they should celebrate on the same day a
> "Women's Day" under the slogan "The vote for women will unite our
> strength in the struggle for socialism\".
>
> During these years, the question of making parliament more democratic,
> i.e., of widening the franchise and extending the vote to women, was a
> vital issue. Even before the first world war, the workers had the
> right to vote in all bourgeois countries except Russia. ^[\[4\]](#n4)^
> Only women, along with the insane, remained without these rights. Yet,
> at the same time, the harsh reality of capitalism demanded the
> participation of women in the country's economy. Every year there was
> an increase in the number of women who had to work in the factories
> and workshops, or as servants and charwomen. Women worked alongside
> men and the wealth of the country was created by their hands. But
> women remained without the vote.
>
> But in the last years before the war the rise in prices forced even
> the most peaceful housewife to take an interest in questions of
> politics and to protest loudly against the bourgeoisie's economy of
> plunder. "Housewives uprisings" became increasingly frequent, flaring
> up at different times in Austria, England, France and Germany.
>
> The working women understood that it wasn't enough to break up the
> stalls at the market or threaten the odd merchant: They understood
> that such action doesn't bring down the cost of living. You have to
> *change the politics* of the government. And to achieve this, the
> working class has to see that the franchise is widened.
>
> It was decided to have a Woman's Day in every country as a form of
> struggle in getting working women to vote. This day was to be a day of
> international solidarity in the fight for common objectives and a day
> for reviewing the organized strength of working women under the banner
> of socialism.
>
> ### The First International Women's Day
>
> The decision taken at the Second International Congress of Socialist
> Women was not left on paper. It was decided to hold the first
> International Women\'s Day on the 19th of March, 1911.
>
> This date was not chosen at random. Our German comrades picked the day
> because of its historic importance for the German proletariat. On the
> 19th of March in the year of 1848 revolution, the Prussian king
> recognized for the first time the strength of the armed people and
> gave way before the threat of a proletarian uprising. Among the many
> promise he made, which he later failed to keep, was the introduction
> of votes for women.
>
> After January 11, efforts were made in Germany and Austria to prepare
> for Women\'s Day. They made known the plans for a demonstration both
> by word of mouth and in the press. During the week before Women\'s Day
> two journals appeared: *The Vote for Women* in Germany and *Women\'s
> Day* in Austria. The various articles devoted to Women\'s Day --
> "Women and Parliament," "The Working Women and Municipal Affairs,"
> "What Has the Housewife got to do with Politics?\", etc. -- analyzed
> thoroughly the question of the equality of women in the government and
> in society. All the articles emphasized the same point: that it was
> absolutely necessary to make parliament more democratic by extending
> the franchise to women.
>
> The first International Women\'s Day took place in 1911. Its success
> succeeded all expectation. Germany and Austria on Working Women\'s Day
> was one seething, trembling sea of women. Meetings were organized
> everywhere -- in the small towns and even in the villages halls were
> packed so full that they had to ask male workers to give up their
> places for the women.
>
> This was certainly the first show of militancy by the working woman.
> Men stayed at home with their children for a change, and their wives,
> the captive housewives, went to meetings. During the largest street
> demonstrations, in which 30,000 were taking part, the police decided
> to remove the demonstrators\' banners: the women workers made a stand.
> In the scuffle that followed, bloodshed was averted only with the help
> of the socialist deputies in Parliament.
>
> In 1913 International Women\'s Day was transferred to the 8th of
> March. This day has remained the working women\'s day of militancy.
>
> ### Is Women\'s Day Necessary?
>
> Women\'s Day in America and Europe had amazing results. It\'s true
> that not a single bourgeois parliament thought of making concessions
> to the workers or of responding to the women\'s demands. For at that
> time, the bourgeoisie was not threatened by a socialist revolution.
>
> But Women\'s Day did achieve something. It turned out above all to be
> an excellent method of agitation among the less political of our
> proletarian sisters. They could not help but turn their attention to
> the meetings, demonstrations, posters, pamphlets and newspapers that
> were devoted to Women\'s Day. Even the politically backward working
> woman thought to herself: "This is our day, the festival for working
> women," and she hurried to the meetings and demonstrations. After each
> Working Women\'s Day, more women joined the socialist parties and the
> trade unions grew. Organizations improved and political consciousness
> developed.
>
> Women\'s Day served yet another function; it strengthened the
> international solidarity of the workers. The parties in different
> countries usually exchange speakers for this occasion: German comrades
> go to England, English comrades go to Holland, etc. The international
> cohesion of the working class has become strong and firm and this
> means that the fighting strength of the proletariat as a whole has
> grown.
>
> These are the results of working women\'s day of militancy. The day of
> working women\'s militancy helps increase the consciousness and
> organization of proletarian women. And this means that its
> contribution is essential to the success of those fighting for a
> better future for the working class.
>
> ### Women Workers Day In Russia
>
> The Russia working woman first took part in "Working Women\'s Day\" in
> 1913. This was a time of reaction when Tsarism held the workers and
> peasants in its vise like a grip. There could be no thought of
> celebrating "Working Women\'s Day" by open demonstrations. But the
> organized working women were able to mark their international day.
> Both the legal newspapers of the working class -- the Bolshevik
> *Pravda* and the Menshevik *Looch* -- carried articles about the
> International Women\'s Day: ^[\[5\]](#n5)^ they carried special
> articles, portraits of some of those taking part in the working
> women\'s movement and greetings from comrades such as Bebel and
> Zetkin.^[\[6\]](#n6)^
>
> In those bleak years meetings were forbidden. But in Petrograd, at the
> Kalashaikovsky Exchange, those women workers who belonged to the Party
> organized a public forum on "The Woman Question." Entrance was five
> kopecks. This was an illegal meeting but the hall was absolutely
> packed. Members of the Party spoke. But this animated "closed" meeting
> had hardly finished when the police, alarmed at such proceedings,
> intervened and arrested many of the speakers.
>
> It was of great significance for the workers of the world that the
> women of Russia, who lived under Tsarist repression, should join in
> and somehow manage to acknowledge with actions International Women\'s
> Day. This was a welcome sign that Russia was waking up and the Tsarist
> prisons and gallows were powerless to kill the workers\' spirit of
> struggle and protest.
>
> In 1914, "Women Workers Day" in Russia was better organized. Both the
> workers\' newspapers concerned themselves with the celebration. Our
> comrades put a lot of effort into the preparation of "Women Workers
> Day." Because of police intervention, they didn\'t manage to organize
> a demonstration. Those involved in the planning of "Women Workers Day"
> found themselves in the Tsarist prisons, and many were later sent to
> the cold north. For the slogan "for the working women\'s vote" had
> naturally become in Russia an open call for the overthrow of Tsarist
> autocracy.
>
> ### Women Workers Day During the Imperialist War
>
> The first world war broke out. The working class in every country was
> covered with the blood of war. ^[\[7\]](#n7)^ In 1915 and 1916
> "Working Women\'s Day" abroad was a feeble affair -- left wing
> socialist women who shared the views of the Russian Bolshevik Party
> tried to turn March 8th into a demonstration of working women against
> the war. But those socialist party traitors in Germany and other
> countries would not allow the socialist women to organize gatherings;
> and the socialist women were refused passports to go to neutral
> countries where the working women wanted to hold International
> meetings and show that in spite of the desire of the bourgeoisie, the
> spirit of International solidarity lived on.
>
> In 1915, it was only in Norway that they managed to organize an
> international demonstration on Women\'s Day; representatives from
> Russia and neutral countries attended. There could be no thought of
> organizing a Women\'s Day in Russia, for here the power of Tsarism and
> the military machine was unbridled.
>
> Then came the great, great year of 1917. Hunger, cold and trials of
> war broke the patience of the women workers and the peasant women of
> Russia. In 1917, on the 8th of March (23rd of February), on Working
> Women\'s Day, they came out boldly in the streets of Petrograd. The
> women -- some were workers, some were wives of soldiers -- demanded
> "Bread for our children" and "The return of our husbands from the
> trenches." At this decisive time the protests of the working women
> posed such a threat that even the Tsarist security forces did not dare
> take the usual measures against the rebels but looked on in confusion
> at the stormy sea of the people\'s anger.
>
> The 1917 Working Women\'s Day has become memorable in history. On this
> day the Russian women raised the torch of proletarian revolution and
> set the world on fire. The February revolution marks its beginning
> from this day.

> ### Our Call To Battle
>
> \"Working Women\'s Day" was first organized ten years ago in the
> campaign for the political equality of women and the struggle for
> socialism. This aim has been achieved by the working class women in
> Russia. In the soviet republic the working women and peasants don\'t
> need to fight for the franchise and for civil rights. They have
> already won these rights. The Russian workers and the peasant women
> are equal citizens -- in their hands is a powerful weapon to make the
> struggle for a better life easier -- the right to vote, to take part
> in the Soviets and in all collective organizations. ^[\[8\]](#n8)^
>
> But rights alone are not enough. We have to learn to make use of them.
> The right to vote is a weapon which we have to learn to master for our
> own benefit, and for the good of the workers\' republic. In the two
> years of Soviet Power, life itself has not been absolutely changed. We
> are only in the process of struggling for communism and we are
> surrounded by the world we have inherited from the dark and repressive
> past. The shackles of the family, of housework, of prostitution still
> weigh heavily on the working woman. Working women and peasant women
> can only rid themselves of this situation and achieve equality in life
> itself, and not just in law, if they put all their energies into
> making Russia a truly communist society.
>
> And to quicken this coming, we have first to put right Russia\'s
> shattered economy. We must consider the solving of our two most
> immediate tasks -- the creation of a well organized and politically
> conscious labor force and the re-establishment of transport. If our
> army of labor works well we shall soon have steam engines once more;
> the railways will begin to function. This means that the working men
> and women will get the bread and firewood they desperately need.
>
> Getting transport back to normal will speed up the victory of
> communism. And with the victory of communism will come the complete
> and fundamental equality of women. This is why the message of "Working
> Women\'s Day" must this year be: "Working women, peasant women,
> mothers, wives and sisters, all efforts to helping the workers and
> comrades in overcoming the chaos of the railways and re-establishing
> transport. Everyone in the struggle for bread and firewood and raw
> materials.\"
>
> Last year the slogan of the Day of Women Workers was: "All to the
> victory of the Red Front." ^[\[9\]](#n9)^ Now we call working women to
> rally their strength on a new bloodless front -- the labor front! The
> Red Army defeated the external enemy because it was organized,
> disciplined and ready for self sacrifice. With organization, hard
> work, self-discipline and self sacrifice, the workers\' republic will
> overcome the internal foe -- the dislocation (of) transport and the
> economy, hunger, cold and disease. "Everyone to the victory on the
> bloodless labor front! Everyone to this victory!\"
>
> ### The New Tasks of Working Women\'s Day
>
> The October revolution gave women equality with men as far as civil
> rights are concerned. The women of the Russian proletariat, who were
> not so long ago the most unfortunate and oppressed, are now in the
> Soviet Republic able to show with pride to comrades in other countries
> the path to political equality through the establishment of the
> dictatorship of the proletariat and soviet power.
>
> The situation is very different in the capitalist countries where
> women are still overworked and underprivileged. In these countries the
> voice of the working woman is weak and lifeless. It is true that in
> various countries -- in Norway, Australia, Finland and in some of the
> States of North America -- women had won civil rights even before the
> war. ^[\[10\]](#n10)^
>
> In Germany, after the Kaiser had been thrown out and a bourgeois
> republic established, headed by the "compromisers," ^[\[11\]](#n11)^
> thirty-six women entered parliament -- but not a single communist!
>
> In 1919, in England, a woman was for the first time elected a Member
> of Parliament. But who was she? A "lady." That means a landowner, an
> aristocrat. ^[\[12\]](#n12)^
>
> In France, too, the question has been coming up lately of extending
> the franchise to women.
>
> But what use are these rights to working women in the framework of
> bourgeois parliaments? While the power is in the hands of the
> capitalists and property owners, no political rights will save the
> working woman from the traditional position of slavery in the home and
> society. The French bourgeoisie are ready to throw another sop to the
> working class, in the face of growing Bolshevik ideas amongst the
> proletariat: they are prepared to give women the vote.^[\[13\]](#n13)^
>
> ### Mr. Bourgeois, Sir -- It Is Too Late!
>
> After the experience of the Russian October revolution, it is clear to
> every working woman in France, in England and in other countries that
> only *the dictatorship of the working class,* only *the power of the
> soviets* can guarantee complete and absolute equality, the ultimate
> victory of communism will tear down the century-old chains of
> repression and lack of rights. If the task of "International Working
> Women\'s Day" was earlier in the face of the supremacy of the
> bourgeois parliaments to fight for the right of women to vote, the
> working class now has a new task: to organize working women around the
> fighting slogans of the Third International. Instead of taking part in
> the working of the bourgeois parliament, listen to the call from
> Russia --
>
> "Working women of all countries! Organize a united proletarian front
> in the struggle against those who are plundering the world! Down with
> the parliamentarism of the bourgeoisie! We welcome soviet power! Away
> with inequalities suffer by the working men and women! We will fight
> with the workers for the triumph of world communism!"
>
> This call was first heard amidst the trials of a new order, in the
> battles of civil war it will be heard by and it will strike a chord in
> the hearts of working women of other countries. The working woman will
> listen and believe this call to be right. Until recently they thought
> that if they managed to send a few representatives to parliament their
> lives would be easier and the oppression of capitalism more bearable.
> Now they know otherwise.
>
> Only the overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of soviet power
> will save them from the world of suffering, humiliations and
> inequality that makes the life of the working woman in the capitalist
> countries so hard. The "Working Woman\'s Day" turns from a day of
> struggle for the franchise into an international day of struggle for
> the full and absolute liberation of women, which means a struggle for
> the victory of the soviets and for communism!
>
> **Down with the world of Property and the Power of Capital!\
> Away with Inequality, Lack of RIghts and the Oppression of Women --
> The Legacy of the Bourgeois World!\
> Forward To the International Unity of Working Women and Male\
> Workers in the Struggle for the Dictatorship of the Proletariat\
