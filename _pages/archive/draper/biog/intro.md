In the early years of this century, prior to World War I, there was in
the United States a growing, vigorous, powerful socialist movement. In
many respects it was further advanced than the British socialist
movement of the time. The usual indicator you run across in the history
books is the Presidential campaign of 1912 in which Eugene V. Debs
gained some 6% of the vote as the candidate of the Socialist Party. But
this statistic in fact underestimates the strength and significance of
the movement. The socialist press, represented by dozens of newspapers
and journals, had a wide circulation. Socialists were an open and well
organized force in the AFL, winning almost a third of the vote for their
candidate in 1912. At the local and state levels numerous socialists
held office and the Party ran a number of municipalities. Despite the
wide scale persecution that accompanied World War I, during the war and
in the early 20s the American left experienced a new surge of growth and
activity. While the Socialist Party split in the early 20s, the labor
movement swung sharply to the left and a serious attempt to build a new
party based on the unions arose. Members of the Socialist Party and the
new parties affiliated with the Communist International played important
and influential roles in this revived labor movement.

For a few years, during the late 20s, this revival appeared to falter.
But the Depression and the collapse of confidence in the capitalist
system even among its beneficiaries changed that. It was in 1932, in the
midst of this widespread radicalization, that Hal Draper joined the
socialist movement. Of course, as the son of immigrant garment workers,
this formal act was not his real initiation into the world of the
socialist and labor movements.

From 1932 until his death in 1990, Hal Draper was a prolific Marxist
writer and a socialist activist. He is one of the few people from that
era who maintained and expanded this American socialist tradition which
has almost disappeared. World War II and the Cold War were a political
space-time warp and very few individuals or political tendencies passed
through it intact. This is true of the socialist movement worldwide of
course but the damage was greatest in the United States. Draper is one
of the few who, instead of abandoning the movement in despair and
rejecting his own political past, analyzed what was happening with the
combination of rigorous research and passionate outrage that is the
stamp of the Marxist tradition. In the 50s, a time of general collapse
and demoralization in the American left, Draper edited the weekly
**Labor Action**, a political journal widely read in Europe as well as
the United States because of its uncompromising rejection of the
American consensus which did not depend on accepting that other form of
despair -- the slavish defense of "real existing socialism" as the only
alternative.

It was not possible, of course, to remain in opposition to the "real
existing crap" of both sides of the Cold War without rethinking the
history of the movement. Draper's 4-volume **Karl Marx's Theory of
Revolution** is his principal achievement in this regard. The works
collected here are manuscripts that were either not published or are
hard to obtain and they emphasize sides of Draper's career and writing
that are not included in KMTR.

It is a truism that the aim of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's *New Deal*
was not to replace the capitalist system, but to save what could be
saved from the wreckage of the Depression by making those concessions he
had to and using them to disarm and demoralize a potentially
revolutionary movement from below. He succeeded admirably. Even today,
when liberals and conservatives alike are dedicated to dismantling the
welfare state he created, even Republicans pay tribute to this "Great
President" and rightly so from their class standpoint. More important,
however, than the immediate impact of Roosevelt's reforms in blunting
popular discontent was the long term benefit. Roosevelt's *ersatz*
revolution destroyed the real socialist movement of opposition described
above. Even historians and pundits who, usually approvingly, note
Roosevelt's role in saving capitalism pay little or no attention to the
movement he was saving it *from*. Draper's essay on the Student Movement
of the 30s is a good short introduction to the real politics of this
period and in fact a good introduction to what Draper represented.

E. Haberkern, 1998
