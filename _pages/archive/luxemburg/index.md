> "Freedom only for the supporters of the government, only for the
> members of one party -- however numerous they may be -- is no freedom
> at all. Freedom is always and exclusively freedom for the one who
> thinks differently. Not because of any fanatical concept of 'justice'
> but because all that is instructive, wholesome and purifying in
> political freedom depends on this essential characteristic, and its
> effectiveness vanishes when 'freedom' becomes a special privilege."

> #### Acknowledgements
>
> Many of Luxemburg's works are still in copyright as they have been
> translated within the last thirty odd years and we are therefore most
> grateful to a number of publishers who have allowed us to place her
> works on the Marxist Internet Archive. We must thank Bob Looker and
> [Random House](http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/home.htm){target="new"}
> for sixteen articles in Rosa Luxemburg, **Selected Political
> Writings**, edited and introduced by Robert Looker, 1974 and to Dick
> Howard and [*Monthly Review
> Press*](http://www.monthlyreview.org/mrpress.htm){target="new"} for
> six articles from **Selected Political Writings, Rosa Luxemburg**,
> 1971 together with eight articles from **The National Question:
> Selected Writings by Rosa Luxemburg**, edited and introduced by the
> late Horace B. Davis, 1976. None of the interesting and informative
> background material in the introductions to these books is on the MIA
> and readers will have to find them in print form. Dick Howard has
> pointed out that he has updated and reworked the materials in the
> *Introduction* to the 1971 book as a chapter in his work **The Marxian
> Legacy** (2nd edition, 1988). We would also like to thank Peter Hudis
> and [*News and Letters*](https://newsandletters.org/){target="new"}
> for permission to publish *Theory and Practice*. We are also very
> grateful to Tessa DeCarlo who has given us permission to put her
> translation of **The Industrial Development of Poland**, originally
> published by Campaigner Publications in 1977. She has slightly revised
> and edited this version.
>
> Finally Monthly Review Press have produced a new edition of
> Luxemburg's works, **The Rosa Luxemburg Reader**, 2004,
> ISBN 1-5837-103-X. Edited by Hudis & Anderson, it contains, in
> addition to a scholarly introduction and improved versions of some
> already published works, some totally new translations by Passmore and
> Anderson including a number of writings on women, slavery and the
> Russian Social Democracy. There is also a fine collection of her
> letters, all new translations called **Letters of Rosa Luxemburg**
> produced by Humanities in 1998. Both of these are not available online
> but are worth reading.
>
> There is a vast corpus of her work in German. The MIA would be
> delighted to publish any previously untranslated material. We have
> also listed above some of her English copyrighted works, in an attempt
> make people aware of the number of these we need to get online.
