# Daniel De Leon

### Internet Archive

The Daniel De Leon Internet Archive (DDLIA) presents the works listed
below through courtesy of the [Socialist Labor Party of
America](http://slp.org). The SLP (established 1877) has graciously
agreed to allow the Marxists Internet Archive to mirror these files on
the DDLIA.

The works assembled here have been transcribed from newspapers and other
periodicals that De Leon edited or for which he wrote. Most come
directly from bound volumes of *The People* (established as a New York
weekly on April 5, 1891) and the New York *Daily People* (1900-1914).

The SLP endeavors to make this Internet collection the first truly
comprehensive library of De Leon's works. Additions to the collection
are being made once or twice a month. Robert Bills, currently national
secretary of the SLP and acting editor *The People*, is responsible for
the work and can be contacted at <slpns@slp.org>

These documents currently appear in Adobe Acrobat (PDF) format. To read
or display them you must have Adobe Acrobat Reader (or Exchange)
installed on your computer. Acrobat Reader is available FREE for
Windows, Macintosh or UNIX operating systems.

As our contribution to bringing De Leon's works to the Internet, the
DDLIA will begin the process of converting these files into HTML for
easier viewing on the World Wide Web. Both [PDF](pdf/index.htm) and HTML
will be available for all the files. Currently the PDF library is quite
large and growing, and is actually **bigger** than our HTML library.
