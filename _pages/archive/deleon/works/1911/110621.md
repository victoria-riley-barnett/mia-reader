# DEMANDS"'IMMEDIATE' AND 'CONSTANT'

## by Daniel DeLeon

*The Daily People*\
June 21, 1911\

A Cincinnati, O. correspondent argues that \--

Whereas the true political party of the workers must come through the
workers, organized on the industrial field; and

Whereas a political party so organized will reflect in its political
platform the demands made on the industrial field; and

Whereas, before the final overthrow of capitalism, which is the constant
demand, there will be many immediate demands"shorter hours, higher
wages, better conditions, etc.

Does it not follow that this political party will and must have an
immediate demand platform?

No; it does not follow.

The reasoning that, until the "constant" demand of labor, the overthrow
of capitalism, is attained, "immediate" demands are bound to appear on
the platform of the true political party of labor, proceeds from a
confusion of the term "demand" as used in the two instances.

The overthrow of capitalism---that is a DEMAND---it is THE demand---it
belongs in the platform of a true political party of labor.

Shorter hours"10 instead of 12, or 8 instead of 10"when really and
ultimately the hours will be nearer to 3 than 8; higher wages, which
means less exploitation, when ultimately wagism is to be abolished; a
minimum of sanitary ventilation in factories, when really and ultimately
the factory is to cease being a hole and to become a parlor; these and
the like are not "demands." They are intermediate stepping stones, to be
discarded soon as possible in the onward march. They have no place in
the platform.

This is not an instance of a "distinction without a difference," or a
"splitting of hairs," or of "substituting a different word for the same
thing," a process which, in fact changes nothing. It is a difference
that goes to the root of things.

The test between demands and non-demands, however desirable the latter
may be, is that the latter are included in the former, as a matter of
course. This feature of desirable but temporary steps places them under
a category, in point of principle and of tactics, distinct from the
category of demands.

An army that takes the field against a city has that city for its
demand. The setting up of tents, digging of trenches, providing for
sanitation, etc. "these are not demands. These are the means toward the
demand; and these means will vary according to circumstances, hence,
need not be enumerated. The demand is ONE"it is the proclamation of the
goal. The so-called "immediate" demands are legion. The specification of
them, or of any of them, is superfluous.

The importance of the distinction lies in its practical bearing. The
moment things that are not in the nature of a demand, because they are
not the goal, are raised to the dignity of a "demand," they are apt to
be, and generally are, confused with the goal itself. A political party
that sets up "immediate" demands by so much blurs its constant demand or
goal. The presence of these "immediate" demands in a socialist platform
reveals pure-and-simple politicianism"corruption, or the invitation to
corruption.

Only the economic organization may and must reach out after crumbs \--
"improved conditions""on its way to emancipation. The very nature of the
organization preserves it from the danger of "resting satisfied." of
accepting "improvement" for "goal." The economic organization is forced
by economic laws to realize it can preserve no "improvement" unless it
marches onward to emancipation.

Otherwise with the political organization. It must be "whole hog or
none." The very nature of its existence"itself only a path clearer for
the economic organization, and only a temporary means"renders the
political organization prone to "rest satisfied" with incidentals and
"improvements."

There is no danger of the true political party of socialism, that is,
the party that flows from classconscious unions, dragging behind it the
navel-string of "immediate demands""as well imagine an Declaration of
Independence with "immediate demands."
