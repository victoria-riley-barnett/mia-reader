"The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. There
can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of
working people, and the few, who make up the employing class, have all
the good things of life.

"Between these two classes a struggle must go on until all the toilers
come together on the political, as well as on the industrial field, and
take and hold that which they produce by their labor through an economic
organization of the working class, without affiliation with any
political party." **Preamble of the IWW**.
