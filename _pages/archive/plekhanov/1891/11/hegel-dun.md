| *In 1891 the editors of **Neue Zeit**, theoretical magazine of the    |
| German Social Democratic Party, requested G.V. Plekhanov to write an  |
| article in connection with the 60th anniversary of Hegel's death. Few |
| were better qualified to deal with this subject than Plekhanov, a     |
| profound student of philosophy and the best trained Marxist           |
| theoretician of Russia at the time. Plekhanov's philosophical         |
| writings, including his Hegel essay, were for the most part written   |
| in the heyday of his brilliant Marxist career, long before his        |
| desertion of the cause to which he owed his fame*.                    |
|                                                                       |
| *Engels, who chose his words carefully, especially on questions of    |
| theory, praised Plekhanov's 1891 essay in the highest terms. Lenin's  |
| views on Plekhanov's philosophical writings were so emphatic that he  |
| took time out to recommend the study of Plekhanov's philosophical     |
| writings while the Civil War was raging in Russia. Exactly the same   |
| was Trotsky's view*.                                                  |
|                                                                       |

| really studying -- all that Plekhanov has written on philosophy, as   |
| this is the best of the whole international literature of Marxism."*  |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the first places in the history of thought indisputably belongs
to a man who died 60 years ago, on November 14, 1831. None of those
sciences, which the French call "*sciences morales et politiques*,"
escaped the powerful and fructifying influence of Hegel's genius.
Dialectics, logic, history, law, esthetics, history of philosophy and
history of religion assumed a new aspect, thanks to the impetus given
them by Hegel.

Hegelian philosophy trained and tempered the thought of such men as
David Strauss, Bruno Bauer, Feuerbach, Fischer, Gans, Lassalle, and,
finally, Engels and Marx. Even during his lifetime Hegel enjoyed world
renown. After his death, from the '30s to the '40s, the practically
universal enthusiasm for his philosophy became even more intense. But a
reaction quickly followed. Hegel began to be treated -- to use Marx's
words -- "in the same way as the brave Moses Mendelssohn in Lessing's
time treated Spinoza, i.e., as a 'dead dog'." Interest in his philosophy
disappeared completely among the "educated" circles. His influence in
the academic world as well became so weak that to this day it has not
occurred to a single specialist in the history of philosophy to define
and point out "the lasting value" of Hegelian philosophy in the varied
fields of knowledge it embraces.

We shall presently explain the reasons for this attitude toward Hegel.
Suffice it to note here that in the near future we may expect a revival
of interest in his philosophy and especially in his philosophy of
history. The tremendous successes of the labor movement, which compel
the so-called educated classes to concern themselves with the theory
under whose banner the movement is developing, will also compel these
classes to become interested in the historical origin of this theory.

And once they do become interested in it, they will quickly discover
Hegel, who will thereby become transformed in their eyes from "a
philosopher of the restoration" into the forefather of the most advanced
modern ideas. And for this very reason we can predict that although
interest in Hegel will revive among the educated classes, they will
never show the same profound sympathy for Hegel as was shown 60 years
ago in countries of German culture. On the contrary, bourgeois scholars
will zealously occupy themselves with a "critical reexamination" of
Hegel's philosophy; and many doctoral diplomas will be acquired in the
course of the struggle with the "exaggerations" and the "logical
arbitrariness" of the dead professor.

Naturally, from such a "critical reexamination" there will be only one
gain for science, namely": the learned apologists of. the capitalist
order will again and again reveal their bankruptcy in theory, just as
they have in politics. But not for nothing has it been said that it is
always beneficial "to burrow around the roots of truth." The revival of
interest in Hegel's philosophy will impel unprejudiced people to make an
independent study of his works. Such mental labor will not be easy but
it will be highly rewarding. Those who really strive for knowledge will
find much to learn from Hegel.

In this article we shall try to evaluate the philosophic-historic views
of the great German thinker. In general outline, this has already been
done by the hand of a master in the excellent articles of Engels,
**Ludwig Feuerbach and the Outcome of German Classical Philosophy**,
which were first published in the **Neue Zeit**, and later appeared as a
separate pamphlet. But we think that the above-mentioned views of. Hegel
fully deserve a more detailed analysis.

The importance of Hegel in social science is determined, first of all,
by the fact that he examined all social phenomena from the standpoint of
the process *des Werdens* (of becoming), i.e., from the point of view of
their rise and dissolution. To many this may not appear as a very great
contribution since, it seems, it is impossible to look at social
phenomena in any other way. But first, as we shall show later, this
point of view even now is not really understood by many who consider
themselves "*evolutionists*." Secondly, in Hegel's day, those engaged in
the social sciences were even further away from this viewpoint. Suffice
it to recall the socialists and economists of the period.

The bourgeois order was, to be sure, looked upon as a very great evil by
the socialists at that time, but they nevertheless considered it as a
perfectly *accidental* product of human *errors*. The economists, for
their part, were delighted by the bourgeois order and were at a loss for
words to praise it, but they considered it as no more than the product
of an *accidental* discovery of the *truth*. Neither the Utopians nor
the economists went beyond this *abstract counterposing of truth to
error* although the teachings of the Utopian socialists already
contained *inklings* of a more correct approach to things.

To Hegel such an abstract counterposing of truth to error was one of
those absurdities into which "rational" thinking so often fell. J.B. Say
considered as worthless the study of the history of political economy
because prior to Adam Smith all economists had advanced erroneous
theories. To Hegel, on the other hand, philosophy was only the
intellectual expression of its time.

At each stage every "transcended" philosophy was *the truth of its
time*, and for this reason alone Hegel could never have discarded all
previous philosophic systems as something worthless, as old rubbish. On
the contrary. "In philosophy," he writes, "the latest \[philosophic\]
birth of time is the result of all the \[philosophic\] systems that have
preceded it, and must include their principles." [\[1\]](#n1){#f1} At
the basis of this view of the history of philosophy lay, of course, the
purely idealistic conception that the "Architect has directed the work
\[i.e., the work of philosophic thought\] and that Architect is the one
living Mind whose nature is to think, to bring to self-consciousness
what it is, and, with its being thus set as object before it, to be at
the same time raised above it, and so to reach a higher stage of its own
being." (**Ibid.**)

But the most consistent materialist will not deny that every given
philosophic system is only the intellectual expression of its
time.[\[2\]](#n2){#f2} And if, in returning to the history of political
economy, we ask ourselves from what point of view must we approach it at
the present time, then we will immediately see how much nearer we are to
Hegel than to J.B. Say. For example, from the point of view of Say, that
is, from the point of view of the abstract antagonism between truth and
error, the mercantile system, or even the physiocratic system, must and
did represent no more than an absurdity which accidentally befell the
human mind. But we know today to what extent each of the above systems
was the necessary product of its time:

If the monetary and mercantile system single out international trade and
the particular branches of national industry directly connected with
that trade as the only true source of wealth or money, it must be borne
in mind that in that period the greater part of national production was
still carried on under forms of feudalism and was the source from which
producers drew directly their means of subsistence. Products, as a rule,
were not turned into commodities, nor, therefore, into money; they did
not enter into the general social interchange of matter; did not,
therefore, appear as embodiments of universal abstract labor; and did
not in fact constitute bourgeois wealth \... True to the conditions as
they prevailed in that primitive stage of bourgeois production, those
unrecognized prophets held fast to the pure, tangible, and resplendent
form of exchange value, to its form of a universal commodity as against
all special commodities. (Marx, **Critique of Political Economy**,
pp.216-17)

Marx explains the polemic between the physiocrats and their opponents as
a dispute over which kind of labor "it is that creates surplus value."
(**Ibid.**, p.64) Is it not clear that this question was completely
"timely" for the bourgeoisie which was then preparing to become master
of everything?

But it is not philosophy alone that appears to Hegel as the natural and
necessary product of its time. He regards both religion and law in this
same way. Moreover, one has to recognize that, according to Hegel,
philosophy, law, religion, art and even technique (*Technische
Geschicklichkeit*) are most closely interrelated: "Only in connection
with this particular religion, can this particular political
constitution exist; just as in such or such a state, such or such a
philosophy or order or art." [\[3\]](#n3){#f3} This, again, can appear
somewhat trivial. Who does not know how closely interrelated are all
aspects and manifestations of national life? At present this is familiar
to every school child.\
 

#### The Laws of Reciprocity

But Hegel did not at all understand the interrelation of the varied
aspects and manifestations of national life in the same way as it is
understood to this very day by many "educated" persons and school
children. This relation is regarded by them as a simple reciprocal
action of the aspects and manifestations referred to. In addition to
this, there is, first of all, the interaction itself which remains
entirely unexplained. Secondly -- and this is of primary importance --
it is entirely forgotten that there must be one common source from which
all these interrelated aspects and manifestations originate.

Thus this system of interaction appears to be based on nothing, hanging
in mid-air: law influences religion; religion influences law, and each
of them and both together influence philosophy and art, which, in their
turn, influence one another, influence law and religion, etc. Such is
the wisdom of this universally familiar doctrine of the primary schools.
Let us grant that for any particular period we can be satisfied with
such an exposition. But after all we would still be left with the
question of just what conditioned the historical development of
religion, philosophy, art, law, etc., right up to the particular
historical period.

Generally, reciprocity itself is adduced in answering this question.
Thereby, in the long run, it ends up by explaining nothing. Either we
have pointed out to us some accidental causes influencing this or that
other aspect of national life, and having nothing in common with one
another -- or, finally, the whole matter is reduced to a question of the
subjective logic of individuals. For example, it is said that the
philosophic system of Fichte logically flows from the philosophic system
of Kant, the philosophy of Schelling logically flows from the philosophy
of Fichte and the philosophy of Hegel -- from the philosophy of
Schelling. In this same way the changes in the different schools of art
are likewise "logically" explained. Undoubtedly, contained here is a
grain of truth. Unfortunately, it explains absolutely nothing.

We know that sometimes the transition from one philosophic system, or
from one school of art, to another, is accomplished very rapidly, in the
course of a few years. At other times, however, centuries are needed for
a transition. Whence does this difference arise? The logical connections
between ideas do not explain it at all. Nor do the references of
academic wisdom to reciprocity and to accidental reasons. But the
"educated" circles are not embarrassed by this. Having uttered
profundities concerning the reciprocal action of the different aspects
of national life, they remain satisfied with this "manifestation" of
their own profundity and stop thinking exactly where *rigorous
scientific thought first fully comes into its own*. Hegel was as far
removed from such profundities as heaven is from earth.

"If we get no further than looking at a given content from the
standpoint of reciprocity," Hegel says, "we are taking an attitude which
is really unintelligent. We are left with a mere dry fact; and the call
for mediation, which is the chief question in applying the relation of
causality, is left still unanswered. And if we look more narrowly into
the dissatisfaction felt in applying the relation of reciprocity, we
shall see that it consists in the circumstance that this relation cannot
possibly be treated as an equivalent for the notion, and ought, instead,
to be known and understood in its own nature. And to understand the
relation of action and reaction we must not let the two sides rest in
their state of mere given facts, but recognize them \... as factors of a
third and higher order \..." (**Enzyklopedia**, Sec.156, *Zusatz*.)

What Hegel means by this is that we must not, when speaking about
different aspects of national life, for example, be satisfied simply to
point out their reciprocity, but must search for an explanation in
something new, something "higher," i.e., something which conditions both
their very existence as well as the possibility of their acting and
reacting upon one another.

Where, then, are we to search for this new, this "higher" something?\
 

#### Hegel's Idealism

Hegel answers that one must search for it in the "notion" -- in the
peculiarities of the national spirit. And this is entirely logical from
his point of view. For Hegel, all history is only "the development and
realization of the universal spirit." The movement of the universal
spirit takes place in stages.

"Every step in the process, as differing from any other, has its
determinate peculiar principle. In history, this principle is \... the
peculiar National Genius. It is within the limitations of this
idiosyncrasy that the spirit of the nation, concretely manifested,
expresses every aspect of its Consciousness and will -- the whole cycle
of its realization. Its religion, its polity, its ethics, its
legislation, and even its science, art, and mechanical skill, all bear
its stamp. These special peculiarities find their key in that common
peculiarity -- the particular principle that characterizes a people; as,
on the other hand, in the facts which history presents in detail, that
common characteristic principle may be detected." (Cf. **Philosophy of
History**, pp.63-4.)

There is nothing easier than to make the brilliant discovery that
Hegel's view of world history as set forth above is permeated with
*idealism of the purest water*. As Hegel would have put it, this is
obvious to everyone, even those who never studied in a seminary. There
is also nothing easier than to limit the "critique" of Hegelian
philosophy of history to a contemptuous shrug of the shoulders because
of its extreme idealism. This is often done by people who are themselves
incapable of any consistent thinking -- people who are not satisfied
with the materialists because they are materialists; and who are not
satisfied with the idealists because they are idealists, and are overly
satisfied with themselves because their own world outlook is supposedly
free from all extremes. Actually, their own outlook is nothing more than
a completely undigested hash of idealism and materialism.\
 

#### "Not a Grain of Eclecticism"

The philosophy of Hegel possesses, in any case, the undisputed merit
that it contains not a single grain of *eclecticism*. And if its
mistaken idealistic basis does make itself felt all too often; if it
does place extremely narrow limits to the development of the genius
thoughts of a great man, then precisely because of this should we study
the philosophy of Hegel all the more closely, for it is precisely this
which makes it so highly instructive. The idealistic philosophy of Hegel
contains the best, the most irrefutable proof of the inadequacy of
idealism. But at the same time if teaches us consistency in thinking. He
who will devotedly and conscientiously pass through this severe school
will forever acquire a healthy aversion to eclectic hash.

We now know that world history is not at all "the development and
realization of the world spirit." But this does not mean that we can
rest satisfied with academic banalities to the effect that the political
order of a given nation influences its customs, while its customs
influence its constitution, etc. We must agree with Hegel that both the
customs and the political structure arise from a common source. What
this source is, is exactly what the modern materialist analysis of
history tells us. Suffice it here to limit our remarks on this subject
to stating that Messrs. Eclectics have as great a difficulty in
understanding historical materialism as they have in penetrating into
the secrets of the diametrically opposed idealistic views of Hegel.

Every time Hegel undertakes to characterize some great historic people,
he reveals encyclopedic knowledge and great penetration. Me gives truly
brilliant and profoundly instructive characterizations, punctuating them
with a whole series of the most valuable remarks about different aspects
of the history of a particular people. He fascinates you until you are
ready to forget that you are dealing with an idealist. You are ready to
acknowledge that he actually "*die Geschichte nimmt, wie sie ist*"
("takes history as it is"), that Hegel strictly adheres to his own rule:
"to keep to the historical, empirical soil."

But why does Hegel need this historical, empirical soil? To determine
the *peculiarities of the spirit* of each particular people. The spirit
of a particular people is, as we already know, no more than a stage in
the development of the universal spirit. But the peculiarities of the
universal spirit are not at all derived from the study of world history.
On the contrary, knowledge of it is *introduced into the study of world
history* as knowledge which is ready-made and completely finished from
all sides.\
 

#### The Contradictions in Hegel

Therefore, this is what takes place: so long as history does not
contradict the "notion" of the universal spirit and the "laws" of the
development of this spirit, history is taken "as it is"; Hegel "keeps to
the historical, empirical soil." But as soon as history not so much
contradicts the "laws" of development of the universal spirit but rather
falls outside the orbit of this assumed development, and appears as
something unforeseen by the Hegelian *logic*, then no attention whatever
is paid to it.

Obviously such an attitude toward history should have at least saved
Hegel from contradicting himself, but actually this is not the case.
Hegel is far from being free of contradictions. Here is a sufficiently
striking example. Hegel writes about the religious conceptions of the
Hindus as follows:

On the one hand Love-Heaven -- in short everything spiritual -- is
conceived by the fancy of the Hindus; but on the other hand, his
conceptions have an actual sensuous embodiment, and he immerses himself
by a voluptuous intoxication in the merely natural. Objects of religious
worship are thus either fantastic forms produced by art, or those
presented by Nature. Every bird, every monkey is a god, an absolutely
universal existence. The Hindu is incapable of holding fast an object in
his mind by means of rational predicates assigned to it, for this
requires Reflection. (Cf. **Philosophy of History**, p.157.)

On the basis of this characterization, Hegel considers animal worship --
zoolatry -- as the natural consequence of the circumstance that the
spirit of the *Hindu people* represents one of the *lowest stages in the
evolution of the universal spirit*. Ancient Persians, worshipping fire
and also "the sun, the moon and five other luminaries," recognizing them
as "the honorable images of Oromaz," are placed by Hegel on a higher
plane than the Hindus. But let us now listen to what Hegel himself has
to say about animal worship among the ancient Egyptians:

Egyptian Cult is chiefly zoolatry \... To us zoolatry is repulsive. We
may reconcile ourselves to the adoration of the material heaven, but the
worship of animals is alien to us \... Yet it is certain that the
nations who worshipped the sun and the stars by no means occupy a higher
grade than those who deify animals, but contrariwise; for in the animal
world the Egyptians contemplated an inner and incomprehensible
principle. (Cf. **Ibid.**, p.211.)

Depending upon whether the Hindu or the Egyptian is under discussion,
the very same animal worship assumes, in Hegel's eyes, an entirely
different meaning. Why is this so? Is it really true that Hindus deified
animals in an entirely different way from the Egyptians? Not at all. The
whole point here is this, that the Egyptian national "spirit" represents
a "transition" to the Greek, and therefore occupies a comparatively high
stage in the Hegelian system of classification. For this reason, Hegel
does not wish to indict the Egyptians for those same weaknesses for
which he indicted the lower-ranking Indian national spirit.

In the same way, depending on whether he meets them in India or in
Egypt, Hegel takes a different attitude toward *castes*. Indian castes
"become natural distinctions," and therefore the individual in India has
even less value than in China where there exists the unenviable equality
of all before the despot. Regarding the Egyptian castes we are told that
they "are not rigidly fixed, but struggle with and come in contact with
one another; we often find cases of their being broken up and in a state
of rebellion." (**Ibid.**, pp.204-5.) But even from what Hegel himself
says about the castes in India, it appears that in India, too, there was
no lack of struggle and contact between the castes.\
 

#### Achilles Heel of Idealism

In this case, as on the question of zoolatry, Hegel, in the interests of
a rather arbitrary logical scheme, has to attribute completely different
meanings to completely analogous phenomena of social life. But this is
not all. The Achilles heel of idealism reveals itself before us
especially in those cases where Hegel has to deal either with the shift
of the center of gravity of the historical movement from one people to
another, or with a change in the *inner* condition of a given people.

In such cases, there naturally arises the question of the causes behind
these shifts and changes, and Hegel as an idealist seeks the answer in
the attributes of the very same *Spirit*, the realization of which
comprises, in his view, history. For example, he asks himself why did
ancient Persia fall while China and India survived. Hegel's answer is
prefaced with the following remark:

In the first place we must here banish from, our minds the prejudice in
favor of duration, as if it had any advantage as compared with
transience: the imperishable mountains are not superior to the quickly
dismantled rose exhaling its life in fragrance. (**Ibid.**, p.221.)

In no case is it possible to consider this prefatory comment as an
answer. There then follows argumentation like this:

In Persia begins the principle of Free Spirit as. contrasted with
imprisonment in Nature; mere natural existence, therefore, loses its
bloom, and fades away. The principle of separation from Nature is found
in the Persian Empire, which, therefore, occupies a higher grade than
those worlds immersed in the Natural. [\[4\]](#n4){#f4} The necessity of
advance has been thereby proclaimed. Spirit has disclosed its existence,
and must complete its development. It is only when dead that the Chinese
is held in reverence. The Hindu kills himself -- becomes absorbed in
Brahma -- undergoes a living death in the condition of perfect
unconsciousness -- or is a present god in virtue of his birth.
[\[5\]](#n5){#f5}

Here we have no change; no advance is admissable, for progress is only
possible through the recognition of the independence of Spirit. With the
"Light" \[the fire-worship\] of the Persians begins a spiritual view of
things and here spirit bids adieu to Nature. It is here, then, \[sic.!\]
that we first find \... that the objective world remains free -- that
the nations are not enslaved [\[6\]](#n6){#f6}, but are left in
possession of their wealth, their political constitution, and their
religion. And, indeed, this is the side on which Persia itself shows
weakness as compared with Greece. (**Ibid.**, p.221.)\
 

#### Idealism Barrier to Explanation

In all this lengthy argument only the last few lines, relating to the
inner organization of the Persian kingdom as a cause of the weakness
revealed by Persia in its conflict with Greece, can be considered as an
attempt to explain the historic fact of Persia's fall. But this attempt
at explanation has very little in common with the idealist
interpretation of history which Hegel held. The weakness of the inner
organization of Persia stands in a very dubious connection with the
"Light of the Persians." Precisely where Hegel remains true to
*idealism*, the best he is able to do is to hide that fact which needs
explanation behind an idealistic curtain. In his hands, idealism
invariably ends up this way.

Let us take as another example the question of the internal
disintegration of Greece. The Greek world was, according to Hegel, the
world of beauty "and of beautiful moral ethics." [\[7\]](#n7){#f7} The
Greeks were a superior people, deeply devoted to their fatherland and
capable of every self-sacrifice. But they achieved great feats "without
Reflection."

For a Greek, "the fatherland was a necessity without which he could not
live." Only afterward "did the sophists introduce principles"; there
appeared "a subjective Reflection," "moral self-consciousness," the
teaching that "each must behave in accordance with his convictions."
From then on there set in the disintegration of the above-mentioned
"beautiful moral ethics" of the Greeks; the "self-freeing of the inner
world" led to the downfall of Greece.

One of the aspects of this inner world was *Reflection*, or thinking.
Consequently, we meet here with the interesting historic phenomenon that
the force of *thinking* acts, among other things, as a "principle of
corruption." Such a view merits attention if only because it is
considerably more profound than the one-sided view of the Enlighteners
for whom success of thinking of any people must lead inevitably and
directly to "progress."

Nevertheless, there still remains the problem -- whence comes this
"self-freeing of the inner world"? The idealistic philosophy of Hegel
answers: "the Spirit could only for a short time remain on the plane of
beautiful moral ethics." But this again is of course no answer, but
merely a translation of the question into the philosophic language of
Hegelian idealism. Hegel himself seems to feel this and therefore
hastens to add that the "principle of disintegration *displayed itself
first* in the external political development -- in the contest of the
states of Greece with each other, and the struggle of factions within
the cities themselves." (**Ibid.**, p.265.)\
 

#### Anticipating the Materialist Interpretation

Here we find ourselves already on *concrete* historic soil. The struggle
of "factions" inside the cities came, in the words of Hegel himself, as
a result of the *economic* development of Greece. In other words, the
struggle of political parties was only an expression of the unfolding
*economic contradictions* in the Greek cities. And if we recall that the
Peloponnesian war -- as is clear from a reading of Thucydides -- was
only the class struggle which spread throughout Greece, then we will
easily arrive at the conclusion that one must seek the principle of the
disintegration of Greece in its *economic* history. Thus in Hegel we
find the anticipation of the rmterialist interpretation of history,
although to him the class struggle in Greece is only a manifestation of
the "principle of disintegration."

To use Hegel's terminology, materialism manifests itself as the truth of
idealism. And we continually run up against such surprises in the
Hegelian philosophy of history. It is as if the greatest *idealist* had
set himself the goal of clearing the road for *materialism*. When he
speaks of the medieval cities, immediately after paying due tribute to
idealism, he analyzes their history on the one hand as a struggle of
citizens against the priesthood and the nobility, and on the other hand
as a struggle of different strata of citizens among themselves, of "rich
citizens against the common people." [\[8\]](#n8){#f8} When he speaks
about the Reformation, he again first reveals to us the secrets of the
"universal spirit," and then makes the following remark -- entirely
surprising on the lips of an idealist -- regarding the spread of
Protestantism:

In Austria, in Bavaria, in Bohemia, the Reformation had already made
great progress, and though it is commonly said that when truth has once
penetrated men's souls, it cannot be rooted out again, it was
indisputably stifled in the countries in question, by force of arms, by
stratagem or persuasion. The *Slavonic nations* were agricultural. This
condition of life brings with it the relation of lord and serf. In
agriculture the agency of nature predominates; human industry and
subjective activity are on the whole less brought into play in this
department of labor than elsewhere. The Slavonians therefore did not
attain so quickly or readily as other nations the fundamental sense of
pure individuality -- the consciousness of Universality \... and could
not share the benefits of dawning freedom. [\[9\]](#n9){#f9} (**Ibid.**,
p.420.)\
 

#### Economic Development as the Source

With these words Hegel tells us clearly that the explanation of the
religious views and of all those liberating movements which arise in
their midst, must be sought in the economic activity of the given
people. But that is not all. Hegel's state reveals itself to be nothing
else than *the product of the economic development*, although, according
to his idealistic explanation, the state "is the actuality of the
ethical Idea. It is ethical mind *qua* the substantial will manifest and
revealed to itself, knowing and thinking itself and accomplishing what
is known and in so far as it knows it." [\[10\]](#n10){#f10}

"A real state," Hegel says, "and a real government arise only after a
distinction of estates has arisen, when wealth and poverty become
extreme, and when such a; condition of things presents itself that a
large portion of the people can no longer satisfy its necessities in the
way in which it has been accustomed to do." (**Philosophy of History**,
pp.85-6.)

Exactly in the same manner Hegel considers the historic appearance of
*marriage* to be closely related to the *economic* history of mankind:

The real beginning and original foundation of states has been rightly
ascribed to the introduction of agriculture along with marriage, because
the principle of agriculture brings with it the formation of the land
and consequentially exclusively private property \...; the nomadic life
of savages, who seek their livelihood from place to place, it brings
back to the tranquillity of private rights and the assured satisfaction
of their needs. Along with these changes, sexual love is restricted to
marriage, and this bond in turn grows into care for a family, and
personal possessions. [\[11\]](#n11){#f11}

We could cite many similar examples. But since space does not permit, we
shall limit ourselves to denoting the significance Hegel attached to the
"geographical basis of world history."

Much has been written *before* as well as *after* Hegel, regarding the
significance of the geographic environment in the historical development
of humanity. But just as up to Hegel, so after him, the researchers
often sinned by having in mind the exclusively *psychological* or even
*physiological* influence of the natural environment on man. They
entirely forgot the influence this environment exerts on the development
of the social *productive forces and, through them*, on all social
relations of people along with all the ideological superstructures.
[\[12\]](#n12){#f12} Hegel was entirely free of this great error in the
*general posing* of the question, although not in this or that
particular aspect. According to Hegel, there are three characteristic
distinctions in geographic environment: (1) the arid elevated land with
its extensive steppes and plains; (2) the valley-plains, criss-crossed
by big rivers; and (3) the coastal regions directly adjoining the sea.

In the first, cattle-breeding predominates; in the second,
*agriculture*; in the third, trade and handicraft. In conformity with
these basic distinctions there are also the variously formed social
relations of the people inhabiting these areas. The inhabitants of the
plateaus -- for example, the *Mongols* -- lead a patriarchal, nomadic
life and have no history in the real meaning of the word. Only from time
to time, assembling in great masses, they descend like a storm on
civilized land, leaving behind them everywhere devastation and
destruction. [\[13\]](#n13){#f13} Civilized life begins in the valleys,
which owe their fertility to the rivers.

Such a Valley-Plain is China, India \... Babylonia \... Egypt. In these
regions extensive Kingdoms arise, and the foundation of great states
begins. For agriculture, which prevails here as the primary principle of
subsistence for individuals, is assisted by the regularity of seasons,
which require corresponding agricultural operations; property in land
commences, and the consequent legal relations \... (**Philosophy of
History**, p.89.)

But the agricultural people inhabiting these valley-plains are
characterized by great inertness, immobility, isolation; they are
incapable of utilizing in their mutual relations all those means which
nature provides. This shortcoming is foreign to the peoples who populate
the coastal regions. The sea does not divide people, but unites them.
That is why it is precisely in coastal regions that civilization, and
together with it human consciousness, reaches the highest degree of
development. It is not necessary to go far for examples. It is
sufficient to point to ancient Greece.

Perhaps the reader is acquainted with the book of L. Mechnikov,
**Civilisation and the Great Historical Rivers**, which appeared in
1889. Mechnikov indubitably has idealistic inclinations, but in general
he nevertheless takes a materialist viewpoint. And what is the result?
The view of this materialist on the historical significance of
geographic environments coincides almost entirely with the views of the
*idealist* Hegel, although Mechnikov undoubtedly would be very
astonished to hear of this similarity.

Hegel also explains the appearance of inequality among more or less
primitive societies as a result, in part, of the influence of
geographical environment. Thus he shows that *before the time of Solon*
the difference between estates in Athens (by "estates" Hegel designates
the various more or less well-to-do classes of the population: the
inhabitants of the plains, the hills and the shores) rests upon the
difference in localities. And undoubtedly the difference in localities
and the difference in *occupations* connected with them must have
exerted a big influence on the *economic* development of primitive
societies. Unfortunately, contemporary researchers very seldom consider
this aspect of the question.

Hegel hardly concerns himself with *political* economy; but the genius
of his mind in this case as in many others helped him grasp the most
characteristic and most essential side of the phenomena. More clearly
than any economist of his time, not even excluding Ricardo, Hegel
understood that in a society based on private property the growth of
wealth on one side must inevitably be accompanied by the growth of
poverty on the other. He categorically asserts this both in his
**Philosophy of History** and especially in his **Philosophy of Right**.
According to him, "this dialectic" -- namely, on the one side, a living
standard for the majority of the population so low that they cannot
adequately satisfy their needs, and, on the other side, a great
concentration of wealth in comparatively few hands -- must of necessity,
lead to a situation where civil society, despite "*the superfluity of
wealth, is insufficiently wealthy*," i.e., has not the means sufficient
to eliminate the superfluity of poverty and of pauperized dregs (*des
Pöbels*).

As a result of this, civil society [\[14\]](#n14){#f14} finds itself
forced to go outside of its own boundaries and search for new markets,
to turn to world trade and colonization. Of all the contemporaries of
Hegel, Fourier alone was distinguished by such clarity of views, and
understood as well the dialectic of bourgeois economic relations.

The reader has undoubtedly noted that, for Hegel, the proletariat is
nothing more than "*Pöbel*," incapable of benefiting from the spiritual
advantages of civil society. Hegel did not suspect how greatly the
modern proletariat differs from the proletariat of the ancient world,
say, the Roman proletariat. He did not know that in modern society the
oppression of the working class inevitably arouses the opposition of
this class, and that in this society the proletariat is destined to far
outdistance the bourgeoisie in intellectual development. But after all,
the Utopian socialists -- for whom the proletariat also was no more than
"*Pöbel*," deserving every sympathy and help, but incapable of any kind
of initiative -- did not know all this either. Only scientific socialism
has been able to comprehend the great historic significance of the
modern proletariat.

### II

Let us summarize what we have said. As an idealist Hegel could not look
on history otherwise than from an idealist viewpoint. He employed all
the powers of his mental genius, all the colossal means of his
dialectic, in order to lend some sort of scientific guise to the
idealistic interpretation of history. His attempt proved unsuccessful.
The results obtained seemed unsatisfactory even to him and he was often
forced to come down from the misty heights of idealism to the concrete
soil of economic relations. *Each time he turned to economics, it raised
him from those shoals where his idealism had led him. Economic
development turned out to be that prius (primary cause) which conditions
the entire course of history*.

It was by this that the further development of science was determined.
The transition to materialism, achieved after Hegel's death, could not
have been a simple return to the naive metaphysical materialism of the
18th century. In the sphere which interests us here, i.e., in. the
sphere of interpretation of history, materialism had first of all to
turn to *economics. To have acted in any other way meant not to go
forward but backward in relation to Hegel's philosophy of history*.

The materialist interpretation of nature does not yet mean the
materialist interpretation of history. The materialists of the last
century looked upon history with the eyes of idealists and, moreover,
very naive idealists. To the extent that they were occupied with the
history of human societies, they tried to explain it by the *history of
thought*.

For them the famous proposition of Anaxagoras, "Reason governs the
world," was reduced to the proposition that human *understanding governs
history*.

They attributed the sad pages of human history to the errors of the
understanding. If the inhabitants of a particular country continue to
patiently bear the yoke of despotism, it is only because they have not
yet understood the superiorities of freedom. If they are superstitious,
it is because they are deceived by priests who have invented religion
for their own benefit. If humanity suffers from wars, it is because it
has been unable to understand how wasteful wars are. And so forth.

The remarkable thinker J.B. Vico had already said at the beginning of
the last century: "*The course of ideas is determined by the-course of
things*." The materialists of the last century held the exact opposite
to be true; the course of things in society is determined by the course
of ideas, while the latter is determined -- well, let us say, by the
rules of formal logic and the accumulation of knowledge.

The absolute idealism of Hegel was very remote from this naive idealism
of the Enlighteners. When Hegel repeated, after Anaxagoras, that "Reason
governs the world," on his lips this did not at all signify that human
thought governs the world. Nature is a system of reason, but this does
not mean that nature is endowed with consciousness:

"The movement of the solar system takes place according to unchangeable
laws. These laws are Reason, implicit in the phenomena in question. But
neither the sun nor the planets, which revolve around it according to
these laws, can be said to have any consciousness of them."
(**Philosophy of History**, p.11)\
 

#### Aims and Results

Man is endowed with consciousness; he sets definite aims for his
actions. But it does not at all follow from this that history pursues
the path that people wish. In the result of every human action, there is
always something unforeseen and it is this unforeseen side which
frequently, or more correctly almost always, comprises the most
essential achievement of history, and it is precisely this that leads to
the realization of the "World Spirit."

"In world history an additional result is commonly produced by human
actions beyond that which they aim at and obtain." (**Ibid.**, p.27)

Men act as their interests demand and as a result of this there comes
something new, something which was, it is true, contained in their
actions but not in their consciousness or in their interactions.
(**Ibid.**, p. 27) States, nations and individuals pursue their private
interests and special aims. To this extent, their actions are
unquestionably *conscious and thinking*. But, while consciously pursuing
their private aims (which are also as a rule permeated with certain
general strivings toward good and right), they unconsciously achieve the
aims of the "World Spirit."

Caesar strove for autocracy in Rome. This was his personal aim. But
autocracy was at the time a historic necessity. For this reason, in
realizing his personal aim, Caesar rendered a service to the "World
Spirit." In this sense one can say that historic figures, as well as
whole nations, are the *blind instruments of the "Spirit."* It forces
them to work in its own behalf by dangling a bait before them in the
shape of private aims, and urging them forward by the spurs of
*passion*, without which nothing great in history is ever achieved.

In relation to human beings there is in this Hegelian view no mysticism
of the "Unknown" whatever. The activity of human beings unfailingly
finds its reflection in their heads, but the historic movement is not
conditioned by this mental reflection. *The course of things* is
determined not by *the course of ideas*, but by something else,
something independent of human will, hidden from human consciousness.

The *accidental nature* of human whims and calculations gives way to
lawfulness, and consequently to *necessity* as well. This is what makes
"*absolute idealism*" unquestionably superior to the naive idealism of
the French Enlighteners. Absolute idealism stands in relation to the
Enlighteners much as monotheism is related to fetishism and magic. Magic
leaves no room for lawfulness in nature: it presupposes that "the course
of things" can be disrupted at any moment by the intervention of the
medicine man. Monotheism attributes to god the establishment of the laws
of nature, but it recognizes (at least in the highest stage of its
development when it ceases to accept miracles) that the course of things
is determined once and for all by these established laws.

Thereby monotheism allows to science a great deal of room. In exactly
the same way absolute idealism, by seeking art explanation of historic
movement in something independent of human whim, posed before science
the problem of explaining historic phenomena in conformity with
lawfulness. But the solution of this problem eliminates any need for the
"*hypothesis of the Spirit*" -- a hypothesis which proved itself
completely worthless for the purposes of such an explanation.

If the views of the French materialists of the last century on the
course of history boiled down to the proposition that human
understanding governs history, then their expectations of the future may
be expressed as follows: Henceforth everything will be arranged and
brought into order by enlightened understanding, by *philosophy*. It is
remarkable that the absolute idealist Hegel assigned a far more modest
role to philosophy.

"One word more about giving *instruction* as to what the world ought to
be," we read in the preface to his **Philosophy of Right**. "Philosophy
in any case always comes on the scene too late. As the *thought* of the
world, philosophy makes its first appearance at a time When the actual
fact has consummated its process of formation, and is now fully matured
\... When philosophy paints its grey in grey, a shape of life has
meanwhile grown old. And though philosophy can bring it into knowledge,
it cannot make it young again. The owl of Minerva does not start upon
its flight, until the evening twilight has begun to fall." (p.20)

There is no doubt that Hegel here has gone too far. While entirely
agreeing that "philosophy" cannot make young again a senile, outlived
social order, one might ask Hegel: But what hinders "philosophy" from
showing us, naturally only in general outline, the character of the
*new* social order which is to replace the old? "Philosophy" examines
phenomena in the process of their becoming. And in the process of
becoming there are two sides: birth and dying out. These two sides can
be looked upon as separated in time. But just as in nature, so
especially in history, the process of becoming is, at each given period,
a *twofold process*: the old is dying out and from its ruins
*simultaneously* the *new* is being born.

Must this process of the birth of the new really forever remain hidden
from "philosophy"? "Philosophy" seeks to know that which *is* and not
that which is someone's opinion it ought to be. But what *is* there in
each given period? There is, to be precise, the *dying out of the old*
and the birth of the new. If philosophy knows only the old that is
dying, then this knowledge is *one-sided*. It is incapable of fulfilling
its task of knowing the existing. But this contradicts Hegel's assurance
that the conceiving reason is omnipotent.

Such extremes are alien to modern materialism. On the basis of what is
*and what is outliving itself* it is able to judge what *is about to
become*. But one must not forgat that our conception of *what is about
to become* is basically different from that conception of *what ought to
be* (*sein sollenden*) against which Hegel directed the foregoing
comment about the owl of Minerva. For us that which is *about to become*
is the necessary result of that *which is outliving itself*, if we know
that *it* is precisely *this* and not *something else* that is about to
become, then this knowledge we owe to the objective process of social
development which prepares us for the knowledge of that which is
*becoming*. We do not counterpose our thinking to the being which
envelops us.

But those against whom Hegel polemicized held entirely different views.
They imagined that thinking can, as it pleases, modify the natural
course of development of *Being*. Therefore they did not find it
necessary to study its course and take it into consideration. Their
picture of that which *ought to be* was gained, not by studying the
actuality around them, but by inferring it from the judgments which they
held at the particular time concerning a social order.

But these judgments were themselves nothing else but inferences from the
actuality around them (predominantly its *negative* side). To base
oneself on these judgments meant to guide oneself by inferences from
this very actuality -- but inferences which were accepted completely
uncritically, and without any attempt, to verify them by the study of
the actuality whence they arose. This is like trying to familiarize
oneself with an object, not by looking at it directly, but at its image
in a convex mirror. In such circumstances, errors and disillusion were
inescapable. And the more men forgot the origin of their pictures of
what "ought to be" in the reality surrounding them; the more they
believed, that, armed with these pictures, they could deal with reality
as they pleased; all the greater became, the gap between what they
strove for and that which they accomplished.

How remote is modern bourgeois society from the kingdom of reason of
which the French Enlighteners dreamed! By ignoring reality, men did not
free themselves from the influence of its laws. They only deprived
themselves of the possibility of foreseeing the operation of these laws,
and of utilizing them for their own aims. But precisely because of this
their aims were unattainable. To hold the point of view of the
Enlighteners meant not to go beyond the abstract contradiction between
*freedom* and *necessity*.

At first sight it seems that if necessity reigns in history, then there
can be no place in it for the free activity of man. This egregious
blunder was corrected by German idealistic philosophy. It was Schelling
who demonstrated that-viewed correctly, *freedom proves to be necessity,
necessity -- freedom* [\[15\]](#n15){#f15} Hegel completely solved the
antinomy between freedom and necessity. He showed that we are free only
to the extent that we know the laws of nature and of socio-historic
development, and only to the extent that we, w*hile subordinating
ourselves to these* laws, base ourselves on them. This was the greatest
conquest in the sphere of philosophy as in the sphere of social science.
This conquest however, was exploited fully only by modern dialectical
materialism.\
 

#### Dialectical Method of Thinking

The materialist interpretation of history presupposes the dialectic
method of thinking. Dialectics was known before Hegel, brut it was Hegel
who succeeded in employing it as did none of his predecessors. In the
hands of this, genius-idealist it becomes the powerful weapon for
knowing all that which exists.

"Dialectic" says Hegel, "is \... the soul of scientific progress, the
Principle which alone gives an immanent connection and necessity to the
subject-matter of science \... the refusal to abide by any one abstract
form of the understanding is reckoned as mere fairness. As the proverb
has it, live and let live. Each must have its turn; we admit the one,
but admit the other also. But when we look more closely, we find that
the limitations of the finite do not merely come from without; that its
own nature is the cause of its abrogation, and by its own means it
passes into its opposite." (**Enzyklopedia**, 81 and *Zusatz*.)

So long as Hegel remains true to his dialectic method, he is a
progressive thinker in the highest degree. "All things, we say, that is,
the finite world as such, meet their doom; and in saying so we have a
perception that Dialectic is the universal and irresistible power,
before which nothing can stay, however secure and stable it may deem
itself."

Hegel is therefore entirely correct when he says that it is of the
highest importance to assimilate and understand rightly the nature of
the dialectic. The dialectic method is the most important scientific
instrument which German idealism has bequeathed to its heir, modern
materialism.

Materialism, however, could not utilize the dialectic in its idealistic
form. It was necessary first of all to free the dialectic from its
mystical shell.\
 

#### Greatest Materialist of All

The greatest of all materialists, the man who was in no way inferior to
Hegel in intellectual genius and who was a genuine disciple of this
greater philosopher, *Karl Marx*, said with complete justification that
his method is the direct opposite to the method of Hegel:

"To Hegel, the life process of the human brain, i.e., the process of
thinking, which, under the name of the Idea, he even transforms into an
independent subject, is the *demiurgos* of the real world, and the real
world is only the external, phenomenal form of 'the Idea.' With me, on
the contrary, the ideal is nothing else than the material world
reflected by the human mind, and translated into forms of thought."
(**Capital**, Vol.1, p.25.)

Thanks to Marx the materialistic philosophy attained a unified,
harmonious and consistent world outlook. We have already noted that the
materialists of the previous century remained rather naive idealists in
the sphere of history. Marx drove idealism out of this, its last refuge.
Like Hegel, he viewed the history of humanity as a lawful process,
independent of human will. Like Hegel, he examined all phenomena in the
process of their birth and dissolution. Like Hegel, he was not satisfied
with the metaphysical, barren explanation of historic events. And
finally, like Hegel, he tried to trace to a single universal *source*
all acting and mutually interacting forces in social life.

But he found this source not in the Absolute Spirit, but in that
economic development to which, as we saw above, Hegel himself had to
resort in those instances where idealism, even in his strong and most
skilled hands, proved an impotent and worthless instrument. But that
which in Hegel was more or less .accidental anticipation of a genius,
became with Marx a rigidly scientific analysis.

Modern dialectic materialism clarified incomparably better than idealism
the truth that people make history unconsciously. From this point of
view the march of his-history is determined, in the final analysis, not
by human will, but by the development of the material productive forces.
Materialism is also aware just *when* "the owl of Minerva" begins to
fly, but in the flight of this bird, as in much else, it sees nothing
mysterious.

It proved capable of applying to history the relationship between
freedom and necessity discovered by idealism. Men made, and had to make,
history *unconsciously* so long as the motor forces of historical
development operated behind their backs and independently of their
consciousness. Once these forces have been discovered, once the laws of
their actions have been studied, men will be in a position to take them
into their own hands and subordinate them to their own rational powers.

The merit of Marx consists precisely in his disclosure of these forces
and his subjecting their operation to a rigorous scientific analysis.
Modern dialectical materialism which, in the opinion of the Philistines,
is bound to convert man into an automaton, in reality opens up for the
first time in history the road to the kingdom of freedom and conscious
activity. But it is possible to enter this kingdom only by radically
changing the existing social activity. Philistines know this or at least
have a premonition of it. Precisely for this reason the materialistic
interpretation of history upsets them and grieves them so. And for this
same reason, no Philistine is ever able or willing to understand or
assimilate fully the Marxist theory. Hegel looked upon the proletariat
as a *mob*. For Marx and for the Marxists, the proletariat is a great
force, the bearer of the future. Only the proletariat (we leave the
exceptions aside) is capable of assimilating the teachings of Marx, and
we see how . the proletariat is actually becoming more and more
permeated with the content of Marxism.

Philistines of all countries noisily proclaim that in the literature of
Marxism there is not one significant work apart from **Capital**. In the
first place, this is not true. And even if it were, it would prove
exactly nothing. How is it possible to speak about stagnation of thought
at a time when this thought each day gains way over masses of followers,
when it opens new and broad perspectives for a whole social class?

Hegel speaks enthusiastically about the Athenian people before whom the
tragedies of Aeschylus and Sophocles were played, and to whom Pericles
addressed his speeches and from whose ranks "appeared individuals who
have become the classic models for all centuries." We understand Hegel's
enthusiasm. Nevertheless, we must note that the Athenians were a
*slave-holding people*. Pericles did not address himself to the slaves,
and the great creations of art were not intended for them.

In our time science addresses itself to the workers and we have every
right to look with enthusiasm upon the modern working class to whom the
most profound thinkers address themselves and before whom the most
talented orators appear. Finally, only in our time has a close and
indissoluble alliance been concluded between science and the workers --
an alliance which will usher in a great and fruitful epoch in world
history.

It is sometimes said that the dialectical viewpoint is identical with
that of evolution. There is no doubt that these two methods coincide on
some points. Nevertheless, there is a profound and important difference
between them which, one must acknowledge, does not at all favor the
doctrine of evolution. Modern evolutionists add to their teachings a
considerable dose of conservatism. They would like to prove that in
nature, as in history, there are no leaps. Dialectics, for its part,
knows very well that in nature, as in human thought and history, leaps
are inescapable. But it does not ignore the incontrovertible fact that
throughout all the moments of change one and the same *uninterrupted
process* operates. Dialectics simply seeks to clarify the entire series
of conditions under which gradual changes must necessarily lead to a
leap. [\[16\]](#n16){#f16}

From Hegel's standpoint, *Utopias* have symptomatic significance in
history; they lay bare the contradictions inherent in a particular
epoch. Dialectical materialism makes the same evaluation of Utopias. The
present growth of the workers' movement is not conditioned by the
Utopian plans of various reformers, but by the laws of production and
exchange. And precisely because of this, in contrast to all previous
centuries, not only reformers but all those public figures who strive to
stop the wheel of history appear as Utopians,

And the most characteristic peculiarity of our epoch is the circumstance
that it is not the reformers, but their opponents, who resort to
Utopias. The *utopian* defenders of the existing unattractive reality
wish to convince themselves and others that this reality in and of
itself has all the possible virtues and that, therefore, it is necessary
to eliminate from it only these or those accumulated evils. In this
connection we cannot help recalling the remarks which Hegel made
concerning the Reformation.

"The Reformation," he said, "resulted from the *corruption of the
Church*. That corruption was not an accidental phenomenon; it was not
the mere *abuse* of power and dominion. A corrupt state of things is
very frequently represented as an 'abuse'; it is taken for granted that
the foundation is good -- the system, the institution faultless -- but
that the passion, the subjective interest, in short the arbitrary
volition of men has made use of that which in itself was good to further
its own selfish ends, and what is required to be done is to remove these
adventitious elements. On this showing the institute in question escapes
obloquy, arid the evil that disfigures it appears something foreign to
it. But when accidental abuse of a good thing really occurs, it is
limited to particularity. A great and general corruption affecting a
body of such large and comprehensive scope as a Church, is quite another
thing." (**Philosophy of History**, p.412.)

There is nothing surprising in the fact that Hegel enjoys, little
popularity among those who love to appeal to the "accidental"
shortcomings whenever a root change of the "thing" itself is involved.
They are terrified by the bold, radical spirit which permeates the
philosophy of Hegel.

There was a time when those who rose against Hegel belonged to one
degree or another, to the revolutionary camp. They were repelled from
the philosopher by his Philistine attitude toward the then existing
Prussian reality. These opponents of Hegel were greatly mistaken:
because of the reactionary *shell* they overlooked the revolutionary
*kernel* of this system. But, at all events, the antipathy of these men
to the great thinker arose from noble motives, deserving of every
respect.

In our time Hegel is condemned by the learned representatives of the
bourgeoisie, and they condemn him because they understand or at least
sense instinctively the revolutionary spirit of his philosophy. For the
same reason they now prefer to be silent about the merits of Hegel. They
enjoy contrasting him to Kant, and practically every college instructor
considers himself called upon to give Kant his due and do not at all
dispute his merit. But what seems to us quite suspicious is the fact
that it is not the strong but the weak sides of Kant which attract the
bourgeois academicians to his "critical philosophy."

More than anything else it is the *dualism* inherent in this system
which attracts the contemporary bourgeois ideologists. And dualism is an
especially convenient thing when it comes to the field of "morals." With
its help, the most bewitching ideals can be constructed; with its help,
the boldest journeys "into a better world" can be undertaken without
bothering for a moment about realizing these "ideals" in *reality*. What
could be better? "Ideally," one can, for instance, abolish entirely the
existence of classes, eliminate exploitation of one class by another,
and yet in reality come forward as a defender of the class state, and
the like.

Hegel looked upon the banal claim that the ideal cannot be realized in
life as the greatest insult to human reason. "What is rational is real;
what is real is rational." As is well known, this proposition has given
rise to many, many misunderstandings, not only in Germany but abroad as
well, especially in Russia. The reasons for these misunderstandings are
to be found in failure to clearly understand the significance which
Hegel attached to the words, "*reason* and *reality*."

It would seem that if these words were taken in their common popular
sense, then even in this case the revolutionary content of the first
part of the proposition "what is rational is real" should strike one in
the eye. In application to history, these words can, signify nothing
else than unwavering certainty in this, that everything rational does
not remain "in a world beyond" but must *pass into* reality. Without
such a fruitful conviction, revolutionary thought would lose all
practical meaning. According to Hegel, history represents the
manifestation and realization in time of the "World Spirit" (i.e., of
reason).

How then explain, from this point of view, the constant change of social
forms. This change can be explained only if we imagine that in the
process of historical development "reason becomes irrational, and the
good, evil." In Hegel's opinion, we ought not stand on ceremony with
reason which has become transformed into its opposite, i.e.,
irrationality. When Caesar seized state power, he violated the Roman
constitution. Such a violation evidently was an onerous crime. The foes
of Caesar, evidently, had every reason to regard themselves as the
defenders of right, because they stood on "the ground of law." But this
right, which they took under their defense "was a formal right, devoid
of living spirit and left aside by the gods." The violation of this
right thus appears as a crime only from a formal standpoint and there
is, therefore, nothing easier than to justify the violator of the Roman
constitution, Julius Caesar.

As to the fate of Socrates who was condemned as the enemy of established
morality, Hegel expresses himself as follows:

"Socrates is the hero who consciously came to know and to express the
higher principle. This higher principle has absolute right \... In world
history we find that this is the position of the heroes through whom a
new world commences. This new principle stands in contradiction to the
existing principle and therefore appears as destructive. For the same
reason the heroes appear to be violently destroying the laws.
Individually they are doomed, but it is only the individual; and not the
principle, which is negated in punishment. The principle itself
continues to operate, even if in another form, and undermines the
existing." (**History of Philosophy**, German ed. Vol.II, p.120.)

All this is clear enough by itself. But matters will become even clearer
if we bear in mind that, as Hegel saw it, not only heroes, not only
individual personalities, but also entire nations step forth on the
arena of world history as soon as they become the bearers of a new
world-historic principle. In these instances the field of activity, over
which the right of the peoples extends, becomes enlarged in the extreme.

"Against this absolute right -- to be the bearer of a given stage of the
development of the World Spirit -- the spirit of the other peoples is
bereft of all rights. The day of these peoples has passed. They
therefore no longer count in world history." (**Philosophy of Right**,
p.347.)

We know that the bearer of a new world-historic principle is at the
present time not any particular nation, but a specific social class, the
proletariat But we shall remain true to the spirit of Hegel's philosophy
if we say that in relation to this class all the other social classes
will enter into world history only to the extent that they are able to
offer it support.

*The irrepressible surge toward a great historic goal, which nothing can
halt -- this is the legacy of the great German idealistic philosophy*.

[7.](#f7){#n7} As is well known, Hegel drew a sharp distinction between
*morals* and *ethics*.

[8.](#f8){#n8} Hegel himself explicitly explains the emergence of Sparta
"as a result of the inequality of possessions."

[9.](#f9){#n9} Hegel remarks: "In contemplating the restless and
ever-varying impulses that agitate the very heart of these cities and
the continual struggle of factions, we are astonished to see on the
other side industry -- commerce by land and sea -- in the highest degree
prosperous. It is the same principle of lively vigor, which, nourished
by the internal excitement of question, produces this phenomenon."
(**Philosophy of History**, p.386.)

Knox, Oxford University Press, 1942, Sec.257.)

[11.](#f11){#n11} **Hegel's Philosophy of Right**, Sec 203. There is no
point to discussing the fact that Hegel's view on the primitive history
of the family and property could not distinguish itself by any great
definitiveness owing to the state of science at the time; but what is
important is that he sensed where it is *necessary to search for the
key*.

[12.](#f12){#n12} Thus, for example, Montesquieu in his **Esprit de
Lois** engages in many discourses on the influence of Nature on the
physiology of man. He tries to explain many historical phenomena through
such influence.

[13.](#f13){#n13} Plateaus lead to narrow mountain valleys, inhabited by
peaceable mountain peoples, herdsmen, engaged partially in agriculture.
Such are the Swiss, Hegel says. Such people one also meets in Asia, but,
on the whole, they are of no importance.

[14.](#f14){#n14} Hegel has here in mind mainly England.

[15.](#f15){#n15} Schelling remarks that freedom is unthinkable outside
of necessity: "For if no sacrifice is possible without the conviction
that the species to which man belongs can never cease to progress then
how is this conviction possible if it is built only and solely on
freedom? There must be something here that is higher than human freedom,
and on which alone action and behavior can be surely calculated,
without, which a man could never dare to undertake a project of large
consequence, since even its most perfect execution can be so thoroughly
disturbed through the intervention of alien freedom that from his own
action something quite different than he intended can result Even duty
can never permit me to be quite at ease about the, results of my action,
immediately it. is certain, that, although my actions are to be sure
dependent on me, i.e., on my freedom, nevertheless the results of my
actions or that which will be developed from them for my whole race, are
dependent not on my freedom but on something quite other and higher.";
**Schelling's Werke**, III. Band, Stuttgart and Augsburg, 1858. p. 595.

[16.](#f16){#n16} Hegel has demonstrated with amazing clarity how absurd
it is to explain phenomena only from the point of view of gradual
change. He writes: "The gradualness of arising is based upon the idea
that that which arises is already, sensible or otherwise, actually
there, and is imperceptible only on account of its smallness; and the
gradualness of vanishing on the idea that Not-being or the Other which
is assuming its place equally is there, only is not yet noticeable;
there, not in the sense that the Other, is contained in the Other which
is there in itself, but that it if, there as Determinate Being, only
unnoticeable. This altogether cancels arising and passing away; or the
In-itself, that inner somewhat in which something is before it attains
Determinate Being, is transmuted into a smallness of external
Determinate Being, and the essential or conceptual distinction into a
difference external and merely magnitudinal. The procedure which makes
arising and passing away conceivable from the gradualness of change is
boring in the manner peculiar to tautology; that which arises or passes
away is prepared beforehand, and the change is turned into the mere
changing of an external distinction; and now it is indeed a mere
tautology." (**Science of Logic**, translated by Johnson and Struthers,
Vol I, p. 390.)
