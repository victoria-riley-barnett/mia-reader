G. PLEKHANOFF (Russian Workmen's Social-Democratic Party) writes: --

Dear Comrade, -- You have asked me the following questions :-

\(1\) What do you think of the passage of the Communist Manifesto which
says that the workers have no country?

\(2\) What practical attitude, what form of propaganda, should
internationalism take in the face of militarism, colonial policy, and
their causes and effects?

\(3\) What part should Socialists take in international relations, as,
e.g., tariffs, factory legislation, etc.?

\(4\) What should Socialists do in case of a war?

As to No. 1, Jaurès thinks that this was not so much the deliberate
opinion of Marx and Engels as an opinion they had formed, under local
conditions, when the workers were in a very oppressed state; this is
also the opinion of E. Bernstein. But it is not mine. If this were
correct it would imply that now the workers should rather be patriots
than internationalists. But, in my opinion, the contrary is the fact,
and internationalism is more held now by the workers than when the
Communist Manifesto was written. The Socialist revolution, which will
put an end to capitalism, must be *international.* Therefore, the
workers must not think so much of their country as of their solidarity
with the *workers of all countries.*

\(2\) Socialists should oppose all these measures as tending to
perpetuate capitalism.

\(3\) Socialists should be guided in these matters by considerations of
tactics.

\(4\) A strike in time of war seems impossible. Every effort should be
made in time of peace to counteract militarism, and thus render war more
difficult.

G. PLEKHANOFF\
Geneva, June 25, 1905.
