| The present pamphlet is being published later than it should have     |
| been. Illness prevented me from finishing it in time. All the same I  |
| am publishing it because Mr. Tikhomirov's fall is still a question of |
| actuality for many readers.                                           |

|                                                                       |
| [1.](#f1){#n1} The occasion for the pamphlet **A New Champion of      |
| Autocracy, or Mr. L. Tikhomirov's Grief** was Mr. Tikhomirov's        |
| pamphlet **Why I Ceased to be a Revolutionary**, which was published  |
| in Russian in Paris in 1888 and caused a great sensation.             |
|                                                                       |
| Lev Tikhomirov, a former member of *Zemlya i Volya*, member of the    |
| Executive Committee of *Narodnaya Volya*, betrayed the revolutionary  |
| struggle and calumniated the Russian revolutionaries. After the       |
| publication of this shameful booklet he filed an appeal for pardon in |
| 1888 and in 1889 he returned to Russia from emigration. Soon he       |
| became one of the most devoted champions and ideologists of the       |
| autocracy and a contributor to, and later the editor of the           |
| reactionary newspaper **Moskovskiye Vedomosti**.                      |
|                                                                       |
| In August 1888, as soon as Tikhomirov's booklet was published,        |
| Plekhanov wrote a review of it, saying, among other things, with      |
| great foresight: "There is the man to trust with editing              |
| **Moskovskiye Vedomosti**! Mr. Tikhomirov's creative mind would be a  |
| real find for our reactionary press."                                 |
|                                                                       |
| **A New Champion of Autocracy** was first published in Geneva in 1889 |
| by the *Library of Modern Socialism* (ninth volume). A second edition |
| was put out legally in 1906 in Petersburg as an appendix to the       |
| journal **Sokol**. This was a reprint of the first edition and it     |
| bore very noticeable traces of censorship: particularly sharp points, |
| especially in the characterization of the Russian autocrats, were     |
| considerably toned down.                                              |
|                                                                       |
| In the present edition the work is printed according to the text of   |
| the third volume of Plekhanov's **Works** (1923-1927), checked with   |
| the first Geneva edition of 1889.                                     |
