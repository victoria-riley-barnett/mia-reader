> "Mental confusion is not always chaos. It may strengthen the internal
> contradictions for the time being but in the long run it will lead to
> their resolution. \... Only the Russian Revolution really opened a
> window to the future; the fall of Czarism brought a glimpse of it, and
> with the collapse of capitalism it appeared in full view. \... at
> last! at last! a way for mankind to escape from war and capitalism."
