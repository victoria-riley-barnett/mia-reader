### (27 August 1898)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Walk up, walk up. Here you are, here you are, the greatest show on
earth. An unrivalled and unsurpassable collection of political
monstrosities, journalistic fakirs, 'patriotic' slum owners,
parliamentarian contortionists, *et hoc genus omne*.

The last few words are Latin. I sling them in here promiscuous like,
just to show off my accomplishments, and impress the reader.

Nothing impresses the reader so much as what he does not understand.
That is why we have so long admired the Home Rule leaders. They but
needed to open their mouths and talk, and talk, and talk, and still to
talk, and the more they talked the less we understood, and consequently
the more we admired them.

We just stood around them with our mouths open like a Malahide codfish
waiting for the tide to come in --

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| And gazed and gazed, and still the wonder grew\                       |
| Where such mere men could learn all they knew.                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

But at last we got tired of waiting and gazing, and began to think, and
the result of our thinking has been a little surprising to ourselves and
will be, ere long, somewhat disastrous to somebody else.

I have been informed by some candid friends that my strictures on
certain leading lights in Irish politics are too extreme, that we should
be more moderate and not run full tilt against so many people.

I admit the soft impeachment. We are somewhat extreme. If we examine the
positions of those who have already come under the lash of the
**Workers' Republic**, we will find that the writers in this paper are
indeed at the extremest possible point removed from the position of
those we criticise.

We are extreme. Like the man who would preach honesty among thieves or
truthfulness among lawyers, we are extreme when we would insist upon
consistency among politicians, or honour among journalists.

We are extreme. As the man who, upon taking his son to initiate him into
the mysteries of Donnybrook Fair, gave him as his sole rule of conduct,
"Whenever you see a head, hit it," we only know one maxim whereby our
public action should be guided, "wherever you see a *lie* expose it,
crush it, stamp it out of existence, even although it came issuing
softly from the lips or embodied in the actions of he who had been your
greatest hero."

We attack no one whose actions do not deserve to be attacked. The best
proof of this lies in the fact that no one has yet been able to
contradict a single assertion we have made.

But come along to the next caravan and see our unique collection of Home
Rule editors, watch the antics of these gay and festive animals,
imported at immense cost from the fertile soil of Flunkeydom.

Here you are, gentlemen. Observe the playful gyrations of these 'leaders
of public opinion' and say have we not reason to be proud of their
abilities.

On the 15th August, 1898, there was held at the Mansion House, Dublin, a
Banquet in commemoration of the patriotic efforts of Wolfe Tone and the
United Irishmen. Toasts were drank and Nationalist speeches made in
accordance with the spirit of the commemoration. *Amongst those present
were the editors of the **Independent**, **Freeman** and **Nation**.*

On Saturday, 20th August, 1898, there was held a Banquet in connection
with the Health Congress in Dublin. The toasts drank included the health
of Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, the Army, Navy and Police.
*Amongst those present were* (uncompromising patriots) *the editors of
the **Independent**, **Freeman** and **Nation**.*

They drank the health of Her Most Gracious Majesty. And every drink cost
as much as would have fed for a day some of the starving Irish families
under the rule of Her Majesty. They toasted the British Army, our
gallant defenders who on the morrow would cut our throats if their
masters, the British governing class, ordered them so to do. They
toasted the Navy -- because it supplies the gunboats which enable our
Irish landlords to send their evicting parties to the islands off our
coasts and so exterminate the inhabitants. They toasted the police,
because they are Irishmen who have sold themselves into the service of
our oppressors, and so perpetuate what Diarmuid McMurchadh began.
[\[1\]](#n1){#f1}

And they are all honourable men, most honourable men.

I have long felt the need of a revision of our National poetry. The
present collections are very good in their way, but on the whole
somewhat antiquated. We need something more up to date.

And as a contribution to such a collection our office boy has just
handed in the appended production of the muse. He assures me he
perpetrated this atrocity in a moment of inspiration after reading the
list of persons present at aforementioned banquet.

Hiccup, hiccup, hooray.

If our journalists can gulp down liquor as easily as they swallow their
principles, what an amount they must have consumed.

The Lord Mayor of Dublin, whose peculiar politics we have already
referred to [\[2\]](#n2){#f2}, in the course of his speech at this
banquet expressed the hope "that the politics of Dublin would yet become
of such a character that the Lord Mayor and the Lord Lieutenant
[\[3\]](#n3){#f3} might yet become more intimate."

To which the **Express** adds, the "logical sequence of such an
utterance is an invitation to the Lord Lieutenant to a banquet at the
Mansion House." These people are great on banquets.

But the **Evening Herald** (Redmondite) chimes in thusly: "The **Daily
Express** is a little too previous \... it will be time enough to talk
of making up when the Lord Lieutenant -- *as Lord Lieutenants were wont
to do before England robbed us of our rights* -- opens the Irish
Parliament."

Note that part I have italicised. If it means anything it means that
England did not "rob us of our rights" until the Act of Union was
passed. Shades of O'Moore, O'Byrne, O'Connor, of Hugh O'Neill, Red Hugh
O'Donnell, Owen Roe, O'Sullivan Beare, of McCracken, Neilson, Napper
Tandy, Wolfe Tone, all of who rose in rebellion against England, before
the Act of Union, that is, before she had robbed us of our rights.

Lord Lieutenants were unknown in Ireland before the Norman invasion.
They have ever represented a foreign dominion, and the fight for Irish
'rights' does not date from the year 1800, but goes back a trifle of 600
years before that event.

As a matter of fact there never was such a thing as an Irish Parliament.
The collection of exploiters who met in College Green were not Irish in
any sense of the term. Their Parliament was no more than the council of
a horde of foreign brigands deliberating as to the best and safest
method of plundering the natives.

Will somebody please start a night school for the purpose of imparting
to Home Rule journalists some knowledge of the elementary facts of Irish
history.

The **Evening Herald** of Monday had a very sympathetic leaderette on
the Dublin Metropolitan Police and their grievances. It hopes those
grievances will be remedied and that the men will be better treated.

How nice. On the 22nd June, 1897, these same policemen broke the heads
of some 300 Dublin men and women for daring to demonstrate their
antipathy to the jubilee rejoicings. [\[4\]](#n4){#f4}

Now, the **Herald** hopes these poor dear policemen will be better
treated by their superiors. Is it as a reward for their jubilee
exertions?

I hope --

That the DMP will get --

Their wages reduced to 16s. per week.

Their hours increased to fifteen hours per day, and no holidays.

And that all promotion will be stopped or given entirely to negroes from
the coast of Africa.

If the **Herald** gets its wish, the police force will be the most
popular situation in Ireland, and our Government will always have a
ready supply of young Irishmen to do its dirty work.

If I get my wish, the police force will become a most unpopular form of
employment, and men who would otherwise be recruits will swell the army
of discontented, and be ready and willing to lend a hand when the time
comes to serve notice to quit on the British Empire.

Please give a copy of this paper to the first policeman you meet as a
love token from a

Spailpín
