# British and Russian Imperialism II

### (1898)

When the Russian disarmament proposals were first mooted we, alone among
Irish journalists, characterised them as dishonest and the chorus of
praise they elicited throughout Europe as hypocritical. One short week
has sufficed to prove the truth of our contention \... There is scarcely
a capital in Europe from which Great Britain has not been complimented
on the successful outcome of the battle before Khartoum; complimented by
the very men (and newspapers) who a week ago were ostentatiously singing
anthems of brotherly love with all men, and deploring the cruel
necessity of war \... The British occupation of Egypt, from the
bombardment of Alexandria down to this latest massacre at Omdurman has
been one prolonged criminal enterprise, conceived and executed entirely
in the interests of the holders of Egyptian bonds and speculating
capitalists.

The enemy, as our Irish newspapers call them, fought for home and
freedom; the British carried fire and sword and desolation into a land
and upon a people who had never injured them, a people who could not
have disturbed their conquest, even of lower Egypt, had they been ever
so willing. But Britain has triumphed. Glorious triumph!
