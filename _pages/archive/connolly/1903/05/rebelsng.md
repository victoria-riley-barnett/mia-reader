| Come workers sing a rebel song,\                                      |
| A song of love and hate,\                                             |
| Of love unto the lowly\                                               |
| And of hatred to the great.\                                          |
| The great who trod our fathers down,\                                 |
| Who steal our children's bread,\                                      |
| Whose hands of greed are stretched to rob\                            |
| The living and the dead.                                              |
|                                                                       |
| *chorus:\                                                             |
| Then sing our rebel song as we\                                       |
| proudly sweep along\                                                  |
| To end the age-old tyranny\                                           |
| that makes for human tears.\                                          |
| Our march is nearer done, with\                                       |
| each setting of the sun.\                                             |
| And the tyrants' might is passing\                                    |
| with the passing of the years.*                                       |
|                                                                       |
| We sing no more of wailing\                                           |
| And no songs of sighs or tears;\                                      |
| High are our hopes and stout our hearts\                              |
| And banished all our fears.\                                          |
| Our flag is raised above us\                                          |
| So that all the world may see,\                                       |
| 'Tis Labour's faith and Labour's arm\                                 |
| Alone can Labour free.                                                |
|                                                                       |
| *chorus*                                                              |
|                                                                       |
| Out of the depths of misery\                                          |
| We march with hearts aflame;\                                         |
| With wrath against the rulers false\                                  |
| Who wreck our manhood's name.\                                        |
| The serf who licks the tyrant's rod\                                  |
| May bend forgiving knee;\                                             |
| The slave who breaks his slavery\'s chain\                            |
| A wrathful man must be.                                               |
|                                                                       |
| *chorus*                                                              |
|                                                                       |
| Our army marches onward\                                              |
| With its face towards the dawn,\                                      |
| In trust secure in that one thing\                                    |
| The slave may lean upon.\                                             |
| The might within the arm of him\                                      |
| Who knowing freedom's worth,\                                         |
| Strikes hard to banish tyranny\                                       |
| From off the face of earth.                                           |
|                                                                       |
| *chorus*                                                              |
