### II

India is regarded by its alien rulers as a huge human cattle farm to be
worked solely in the interest of the dominant class of another nation.
Whatever is done for the development of its vast internal resources is
done not for the benefit of the Indian people but primarily with a view
to the dividends which the investing classes of England may draw from
such development. The salt tax, a tax upon a first necessary of life, is
ten times higher today than it was ever known to be under the Mussulman
rulers of India. More than one humane English Governor has confessed his
reluctance to increase this tax upon the helpless peasantry, yet it is
to-day as high as 1,000 or 1,200 per cent. As in Ireland during the
famine years, the Government rated famine-stricken districts for the
relief of their own poor, and so crushed into pauperism those who had
managed to survive the loss of their potato crop; so in India, whenever
the Government extends financial help to a famine-stricken population it
seeks to recoup itself for the outlay by an increase in the salt tax. In
other words, it gives relief with one hand and with the other increases
the taxes upon the food of a famishing people. In the great famine of
thirty years ago in Southern India, when it was estimated that no less
than six millions of people had perished of hunger, the salt tax was
increased by forty-five per cent. The benevolent rulers of India have
also, in order to secure this source of income to their exchequer,
prohibited under severe penalties all native manufacture of salt, and
when the helpless people, unable to buy salt to season their food,
endeavored to scrape a condiment from the deposits left by the receding
ocean upon the rocks and pebbles of the sea-shore, they were prosecuted
for defrauding the revenue. This devotion of the rulers of India to the
letter of the law in this respect stands out in marked contrast to their
action in another, viz., in squandering in useless frontier expeditions
the Famine Relief Fund, which, as its name indicates, was intended for
emergencies like the present.

During the nineteenth century India lost no less than sixteen million
(16,000,000) people by starvation. All this time she has enjoyed the
ameliorative influence of civilization on the British Imperial pattern,
and in the full felicity borne of that enjoyment her children have died
off like rotten sheep, while the hack-apologists of the English
governing classes have vied with each other in unctuous laudations of
'our civilizing mission', and our 'benign rule'.

Yet, in spite of all their anxiety to suppress the truth about India,
the official class in whose interests this systematic distortion of
facts is practised cannot entirely exclude even from their own organs in
the press the awful record of the results of their rule. Here for
instance is an extract from the **Indian Pioneer**, an organ of
Anglo-Indian officialdom, of 7th February, 1880, which tells its own
tale:

> The hired laborer is always on the verge of starvation. Out of the
> 109,000,000 in British India, laborers are estimated at 30,000,000.
> Last year after the heavy rainfall there was frightful mortality from
> fever, according to the recent sanitary report an increase of 900,000
> on the average rate of mortality. There would appear to be a good deal
> of truth in the opinion of one officer, who reported that *the disease
> is aggravated by want of food, which at all times prevails amongst the
> lowest classes.*

Yet that great Home Ruler, Mr. Alfred Webb, not so long ago informed the
readers of the **Freeman's Journal** that "the Indians know their duty
to their Sovereign *and are loyal*." To what?

But, at least, we may be told, India has profited intellectually by her
subjection; is not education fostered by the Imperial Government? Yes;
it spends on education in India one-fiftieth part of its net revenue
there, whereas in England and Scotland alone it spends under the same
heading about one twenty-fourth part of the revenue of the United
Kingdom. Again, as Irish Nationalists remember that it was the wholesome
fear engendered in the English governing classes by the Fenian
conspiracy, which led to the disestablishment of the Irish Church, so
thoughtful Indians are not likely to forget that the year which saw the
establishment of the universities of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras had
also seen the smoke and fire of the Indian mutiny.

But has not religion benefited by the British Conquest of India? Well,
for every Christian Church in India maintained by the free contributions
of Christian people at home the Government establishes brothels for the
use of its soldiers, the one frequently in sight of the other. For every
Christian made the example of the British garrison from Tommy Atkins
upward has made an hundred drunkards. Am I exaggerating? Listen to the
words of this Englishman, Mr. Alfred S. Dyer, writing some years ago
from Allahabad to the **Christian Commonwealth**:

> If the people of Great Britain, and especially the Christians of Great
> Britain, do not interfere to stop the mad career of the handful of
> sin-supporting politicians who are at present in power in India, there
> can be no doubt that that career will be stopped by other means \...
>
> As I stood amid the scenes of the mutiny at Cawnpore, and then at
> Lucknow, and then at Delhi, I realized how easily national judgment
> can follow national sin, as effect follows cause. I realized it afresh
> as a few weeks since at Peshawur, the border city of India and
> Afghanistan, I looked towards the entrance of the Khyber Pass, of
> disastrous memory, and remembered the tale of the first British Afghan
> campaign. History uses the convenient word emeute\' to cover the
> character of the incident which led to the fatal ending of that
> unjustifiable enterprise. The truth seems to be that the indignation
> of the Afghans at the treatment of their women, principally by
> officers, led to the rising which turned the tide against the
> licentious English, and led to the retreat to Jellalabad, in which the
> whole army perished with the exception of one man.

> Another so-called 'emeute' similar to that may occur among the hardy

> at Peshawur and other cities and places near. At Peshawur, from the
> door of their compound, the women can see the men, for whose lust they
> are licensed, paraded for 'divine service'. The people talk about
> these things. The impurity of the officers, as well as the rank and
> file, is thrown up in the faces of the missionaries, as two at
> Peshawur themselves told me.

Religion, in fact, in India, as everywhere else, loses by being
identified with the forces of a tyrannical government.

The earlier English East India Company, when it totally prohibited the
teaching of Christianity to the natives under its control, did not do as
much to prevent its adoption by the Indians as the present governors do
when they ostentatiously parade their Sunday religion before a people
who have witnessed the immorality of their week-day lives. Even the
ordinary administration of law in India in the most peaceful times is
saturated with a barbarism unknown elsewhere, and only partly
approximated to by the expiring Russian despotism in its present fight
against freedom. For instance: According to Sir Henry Cotton, M.P.,
K.C.S.I., floggings in India are publicly inflicted upon adult male and
female offenders, and for petty theft and the like. The last year for
which figures are available, 1902, no fewer than 25,186 judicial
floggings were inflicted. These are carried out in public. "The
triangles," he writes, "are an unpleasant feature outside every Court in
India. I have known floggings so severe that the victims have died in
the triangles to which they were tied."

England, in short, has only one use for India. She sees there a spot
revealed by an All-wise Providence for the specific purpose of providing
comfortable positions and fat salaries and pensions to the younger sons
and poor relations of the English moneyed classes. Therefore, as any
efforts to entrust the government of India to the children of the soil
would necessarily displace those sinecurists from their snug berths and
salaries, all suggestions pointing in that direction must be branded as
rank heresy, if not political incendiarism. In Java, under the rule of
the Dutch, the natives share in the government of their country. In the
words of Sir David Wedderburn, "the Asiatic races are subordinated to
their own recognized chiefs, and these are responsible to the Government
for the maintenance of order." Thus the most important official
positions are open to the natives. In the independent native States of
India, before the Conquest, all posts, according to the Anglo-Indian
writer, Marshman, were open to universal competition. What, then is the
net result of British rule in India? "The main evil of our rule," said
Sir T. Munro, Governor of Madras in 1819, "is the degraded state in
which we hold the native," and as a corollary to this statement one of
our contemporary writers, Sir James Caird, informs us from personal
investigation that "in the native States the people are more prosperous
than under our rule, and they have not been driven into the evil hands
of the sowcars (money-lenders) as our ryots (peasants) have been." A few
months ago famine in all its horrors was once more devastating the
country, and once more the native States were exempt from the calamity.
The English Government officials for months denied the accuracy of the
reports which, despite their vigilance, filtered through to Europe, and
then, when the awful truth could no longer be concealed, they, like
Pilate of old, called heaven and earth to witness they were guiltless of
the blood of this people. And once more they called upon the charitable
to contribute to the relief of the destitute, whilst they prepared,
horse, foot and artillery, to insure that not one penny of the tribute,
the exaction of which has created the destitution, shall be withheld
from the British Exchequer, or devoted to the people they have ruined.
The people in India require justice, but justice is exactly what they
must not expect. Justice is prosaic, dull and unsentimental, and cannot
be advertised in Mansion House Funds, or prated about by royal and
aristocratic dignities. Charity, however, though utterly useless for the
purpose of staying the ravages of famine among a population of
thirty-six millions perishing beneath it, yet fulfils the purpose of
those who desire to hear their own trumpet blowing and see their names
advertised side by side with the elite of society and in company with
royalty. Above all, it does not interfere with the ceaseless flow of
Indian tribute into the, coffers of their conquerors. Therefore, justice
India must not expect, but charity (D.V.) she will have. "Look well at
the background of this fine picture, and lo, the reeking shanks and
yellow chapless skulls of Skibbereen, and the ghosts of starved Hindoos
in dusky millions."
