------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the Irish Socialist Federation was first founded the action of its
originators evoked a great deal of adverse criticism. We believe the
launching of our journal will evoke still more. It is fitting,
therefore, that we should devote some little space to explaining the
central idea of this new venture in the fields of Socialist activity. We
do so in no apologetic mood (our course is marked and mapped, and we
shall resolutely pursue it), but in the belief that the more our purpose
is understood the more will our methods be appreciated and endorsed.

The editor of this paper, the present writer, has been in the Socialist
movement more years than he cares to enumerate, and in several countries
as well as his own, and in each of the former he has noted with regret
the adoption by Irishmen as soon as they became Socialists of a line of
conduct fatal to the best interests of the Socialist cause amongst our
people. To illustrate this, let us ask the reader to conjecture what
should be the first result of the winning to Socialism of a worker of
the Irish race. Obviously the first result should be that he should
become a medium for, so to speak, translating Socialist ideas into terms
of Irish thought, and a channel for conveying the Socialist message to
others of his race.

But this he could only do as long as his Socialism did not cause him to
raise barriers betwixt him and his fellow countrymen and women, to
renounce his connection with, or to abjure all the ties of kinship and
tradition that throughout the world make the heart of one Celt go out to
another, no matter how unknown. Yet this is precisely what their
adoption of Socialism has caused in the great majority of cases amongst
Irishmen. Led away by a foolishly sentimental misinterpretation of the
Socialist doctrine of Universal Brotherhood, or Internationalism, they
generally began by dropping out of all Irish societies they were
affiliated with, no matter how righteous their objects were, and ended
by ceasing to mix in Irish gatherings or to maintain Irish connections.
The result upon the minds of their fellow countrymen and women was as
might be expected. At home and abroad the Irish Celt has had to keep up
a perpetual watch and ward against insidious and relentless foes; for
hundreds of years England has had the ear of the world, pouring into it
calumnies and hatred of the Irish until the latter had become an Ishmael
among the nations, and nowhere more so than in America. The bitter words
of our poet --

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Aye, bitter hate and cold neglect,\                                   |
| Or lukewarm love at best,\                                            |
| Is all we've had or can expect,\                                      |
| We aliens of the West.                                                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

simply chronicled truthfully the international status of our race.

Under such circumstances, and we repeat those were and are the normal
conditions of our existence as Irish -- under such circumstances the man
or woman who broke away from and kept aloof from contact with things
Irish and with an Irish environment became, in the eyes of their fellow
countrymen and women, deserters from the weaker side in a fight, and
therefore objects of opprobrium and of hatred. In the case of those who
became Socialists this was invariably the course of events; the dislike
and hatred did not precede, but followed the breaking away from Irish
associations. Had the convert to Socialism showed that his conversion
did not operate to make him hold aloof from his fellow countrymen, or to
decry their cause, he would have become a medium for attracting the
Irish, instead of repelling them, and each fresh Irish recruit to our
cause would have meant an added power of convincing the Irish worker
that Socialism made its devotees better equipped mentally and morally to
combat oppression than any scheme evolved by the invertebrate Irish
middle class politicians; but this is just what the Federation and its
organ proposes to do. We propose to show all the workers of our fighting
race that Socialism will make them better fighters for freedom without
being less Irish; we propose to advise the Irish who are Socialists now
to organize their forces as Irish and get again in touch with the
organized bodies of literary, educational and revolutionary Irish; we
propose to make a campaign amongst our countrymen, and to rely for our
method mainly upon imparting to them a correct interpretation of the
facts of Irish history, past and present; we propose to take the control
of the Irish vote out of the hands of the slimy seoiníní who use it to
boost their political and business interests to the undoing of the Irish
as well as the American toiler; we propose to challenge all the other
federations and nationalities in this country to a generous rivalry in
the work of our common emancipation; and we propose, finally, to show
the world that after seven hundred years battling against a mighty
oppressor we are still, as a race, lusty and vigorous for the fight, and
that abreast with the march of the intellect of the world we raise the
ideal of the legions of our unforgotten dead, "Ireland for the Irish",
on to the plane of the higher, nobler and all comprehending "World for
the workers".

Thus all may see and learn that

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Ireland has no leper sores\                                           |
| Her eye is clear, her stature strong,\                                |
| Still thro' her veins the life blood pours                            |
|                                                                       |
| In mighty tides of speech and song.\                                  |
| She watches by eternal shores\                                        |
| The birth of Right, the death of Wrong.                               |
