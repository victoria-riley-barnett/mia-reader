#### New York, January 1908

The Irish Socialist Federation is composed of members of the Irish race
in America, and is organised to assist the revolutionary working-class
movement in Ireland by a dissemination of its literature, to educate the
working-class Irish of this country into a knowledge of Socialist
principles and to prepare them to co-operate with the workers of all
other races, colours and nationalities in the emancipation of labour.

It affirms its belief that political and social freedom are not two
separate and unrelated ideas, but are two sides of the one great
principle, each being incomplete without the other.

The course of society politically has been from warring but democratic
tribes within each nation to a united government under an absolutely
undemocratic monarchy. Within this monarchy again developed revolts
against its power, revolts at first seeking to limit its prerogatives
only, then demanding the inclusion of certain classes in the governing
power, then demanding the right of the subject to criticise and control
the power of the monarch, and finally, in the most advanced countries,
this movement culminated in the total abolition of the monarchial
institution and the transformation of the subject into the citizen.

In industry a corresponding development has taken place. The independent
producer, owning his own tools and knowing no master, has given way
before the more effective productive powers of huge capital,
concentrated in the hands of the great capitalist. The latter,
recognising no rights in his workers, ruled as an absolute monarch in
his factory. But within the realm of capital developed a revolt against
the power of the capitalist. This revolt, taking the form of trade
unionism, has pursued in the industrial field the same line of
development as the movement for political freedom has pursued in the
sphere of national government. It first contented itself with protests
against excessive exactions, against all undue stretchings of the power
of the capitalist, then its efforts broadened out to demands for
restrictions upon the absolute character of such power, i.e., by
claiming for trade unions the right to make rules for the workers in the
workshop; then it sought still further to curb the capitalist\'s power
by shortening the working day and so limiting the period during which
the toiler may be exploited. Finally, it seeks by Boards of Arbitration
to establish an equivalent in the industrial world for that compromise
in the political world by which, in constitutional countries, the
monarch retains his position by granting a parliament to divide with him
the duties of governing, and so hides while securing his power. And as
in the political history of the race, the logical development of
progress was found in the abolition of the institution of monarchy and
not in its mere restriction, so in industrial history the culminating
point to which all efforts must at last converge lies in the abolition
of the capitalist class and not in the mere restriction of its power.

It recognises in all past history a preparation for this achievement,
and in the industrial tendencies of today it hails the workings out of
those laws of human progress which bring that object within our reach.

The concentration of capital in the form of trusts simplifies the task
we propose that society shall undertake and the industrial organisation
of labour resultant therefrom drills and prepares the force necessary to
its accomplishment.

As today the organised power of the State theoretically guarantees to
every individual his political rights, so in the Socialist Republic the
power and productive forces of organised society will stand between
every individual and want, guaranteeing that right to life without which
all other rights are but mockery.

The Irish Socialist Federation, recognising these two phases of human
development, pledges its members to fealty to the principles resultant
therefrom, politically rejecting the domination of nation over nation as
of man over man; it on the field of Irish politics is organised against
every party recognising British rule in Ireland in any form or manner,
in all its moods and modifications; and as the final solution of the
Irish, as of every other struggle for freedom, it seeks the Workers'
Republic -- the administration of all the land and instruments of
labour, all social property in which all shall be co-heirs and owners.
