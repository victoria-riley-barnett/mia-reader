Fellow Countrymen:--

We are to-day face to face with a new crisis in Irish political history.
The reactionary Tory Party -- sworn supporters of every kind of royal,
aristocratic, and capitalistic privilege -- once more dominates the
English Parliament; the Liberal Party, long and blindly trusted by so
many of our fellow countrymen, has proven itself to be to-day as
treacherous and corrupt as it has ever been in the past, when it
succeeded in obtruding its slimy influence across the field of Irish
politics; the Home Rule Party, split up into a dozen intriguing
sections, seek by senseless vilification of each other's character to
hide their own worthlessness and incapacity; in the country the tenantry
seek in vain for relief from the economic pressure, born of landlord
robbery; and in the towns the employing class strive by every means in
their power to still further reduce the wages and deepen the misery of
their unfortunate employees. On all sides personal vanity, personal
ambition, and overmastering greed are seen to be the controlling factors
in public life, and Truth, Freedom, and Justice are forgotten, or
remembered only to round off a period or give a finish to a peroration
in a speech of some huckstering politician. Such is the state of Irish
politics to-day. Fellow workers -- the struggle for Irish freedom has
two aspects: it is national and it is social. Its national ideal can
never be realized until Ireland stands forth before the world, a nation
free and independent. It is social and economic; because no matter what
the form of government may be, as long as one class own as their private
property the land and instruments of labor, from which all mankind
derive their subsistence, that class will always have it in their power
to plunder and enslave the remainder of their fellow creatures. Its
social ideal, therefore, requires the public ownership by the Irish
people of the land and instruments of production, distribution, and
exchange to be held and controlled by a democratic state in the
interests of the entire community. But every Irish movement of the last
200 years has neglected one or the other of these equally necessary
aspects of the national struggle. They have either been agrarian and
social, and in the hunt after some temporary abatement of agricultural
distress have been juggled into forgetfulness of the vital principles
which lie at the base of the claim for National Independence, or else
they have been national and under the guidance of middle-class and
aristocratic leaders, who either did not understand the economic basis
of oppression, and so neglected the strongest weapon in their armory,
or, understanding it, were selfish enough to see in the national
movement little else than a means whereby, if successful, they might
intercept and divert into the pockets of the Irish middle-class a
greater share of that plunder of the Irish worker which at present flows
across the channel. The failure of our so-called 'leaders' to grasp the
grave significance of this two-fold character of the "Irish Question" is
the real explanation of that paralysis which at constantly recurring
periods falls like a blight upon Irish politics. The party which would
aspire to lead the Irish people from bondage to freedom must then
recognize both aspects of the long-continued struggle of the Irish
Nation. Such a party is the newly-formed Irish Socialist Republican
Party. In its resolve to win complete separation from all connection
with the British Empire, and the establishment of an Irish Socialist
Republic, it embodies to the full the true Irish ideal -- an independent
nation with a social-democratic organization of society, thus adapting
to the altered environment of the nineteenth century the vital principle
of common ownership of the means of life which inspired the Brehon laws
of our ancient forefathers. In its program of immediately practical
reforms will be found the only feasible proposals yet formulated, either
for averting from Irish farming the ruin with which it is threatened by
the competition of the mammoth farms and scientifically equipped
agriculture of America and Australia, for lessening the tide of
emigration or for using the political power of the Irish people with
potent effect in paving the way for the realization of a revolutionary
ideal. We ask you then to join our ranks; to spread our ideas; to work
for our success, which means your emancipation; to help us to blend the
twin streams of National and Industrial Freedom into one irresistible
torrent, sweeping all obstacles before it, and bearing grandly onward on
its bosom the toiling millions of the Irish race, proudly enthusiastic
in their desire to join the mighty ocean of lovers of Humanity who in
every clime under the sun are working and hoping for the time when
oppression and privilege will be no more; when "every man will be a
Kaiser, every woman be a queen."
