This month I wish to say a few words about signs of progress. As
Socialists we have to spend so much time and energy pointing out the
decrepitude and imbecility of capitalist society, so much time and
energy in rousing our fellow slaves to a proper hatred of the degrading
conditions under which we live and suffer, that we are apt to overlook
the thousand and one factors that are making for the regeneration of the
social order.

It is well to be discontented; it is well to have a heart hot with
passionate hatred of injustice; it is well to be a rebel against a
social system that makes for iniquity; it is well to be ceaseless in
your denunciations of the wrong that sitteth in the seats of the mighty,
but it is also well to have a hopeful spirit, and an eye to note and
appreciate all those manifestations of social activity, organized and
unorganized, that indicate the stirring of the human conscience, the
restlessness of the human intellect under capitalist conditions.

Let the "canting fed classes" purr their approval of the preachers of
contentment and resignation, I at least wish to reserve my tribute of
praise to the men and women who succeed in arousing in their fellows a
divine discontent with a system "conceived in sin and begotten in
iniquity".

Discontent, my friends, is the fulcrum on which the lever of thought has
ever moved the world to action. Therefore blessed be discontent: Let no
man repress within himself the stirrings of hatred of injustice, of
discontent; they are the manifestations of the divine impulse towards
better things, the workings of the leaven that shall transform the
soulless slave into the perfect freeman.

Discontent! Let us see: Have we anything to be discontented with. I
quote from a report in the Chicago **Daily Socialist** the following
description of conditions in the South, as they were told by a delegate
from that territory:

> "Little children five years old have to go out and hoe cotton in May,
> June and July," he said. "In August and part of September they go to
> school.
>
> "In September the cotton picking begins and the parents of these
> little children drive them like so many little ponies back to the
> cotton fields and drive the little tots to work. It takes constant
> driving and watching to make them work.
>
> "Later the weather begins to get quite chilly and fires are built
> where these little workers stop now and then to warm their little toes
> and fingers. They don't seem to understand why they have to be driven
> away from these warm fires back to the frosty fields.
>
> "Finally these people reach the starvation point and are no longer
> able to work. Then they begin to borrow, beg and finally steal. They
> lose all moral sense and the landlords drive the families away from
> the farms.
>
> "The cotton field paupers then become slaves in the factories of the
> large cities of the South and sink to the lowest depths."

That is bad, and so some workers are foolish enough to be discontented.
But the officials of the capitalist republic of the United States are
also discontented. Thus I see that Admiral Robley D. Evans (Fighting
Bob), realising that there is a weakness somewhere, rises and in his
bluff, sailor like manner demands a remedy. And what is his remedy?

"We need 48 more battleships."

I am not sure that he meant this as a remedy for the oppression of
little children by the capitalist class of the United States, but I am
sure that he imagined the need, real or imaginary, of more battleships
to be the only thing worth talking about.

And I am also sure that the capitalist press of the United States
acquiesced in his point of view, for his remarks were heralded far and
wide whilst the awful conditions pictured in the report I have just
quoted are scarcely deemed worthy of an occasional paragraph.

Such is the capitalist conception of statesmanship. Untold fruits of the
perverted ingenuity of men to be devoted to the task of destroying human
life, but at best cold neglect or a passive indifference to every
suggestion for the preservation and ennobling of the lives of the
workers.

Nevertheless how the heart of the patriotic American must have throbbed
within him as he read of the splendid reception given to the US fleet
upon the Pacific coast, how he must have felt honored when he reflected
that those noble vessels, so ably manned by such a gallant crew, were
American, and that he, as an American citizen, was honored also in the
honors so lavishly heaped upon 'his' sailors and 'his' fleet.

Of course those poor oppressed little tots of children working in the
cotton fields are American also, and by analogy every cruelty and every
outrage inflicted upon them are also inflicted upon the 'honor' and
'patriotism' of the whole American citizenship that tolerate such a
state of affairs, but then as the great American press does not draw
that moral of course the great American public does not allow it to
impair its digestion.

As a once favorite writer of mine has said: "Such is modern
civilization: brilliant and beautiful where it rises into the sunlight,
but within it is full of dead men's bones -- the bones of the poor who
built it."

But what about those signs of progress. Dear, oh, dear, my imagination
has led me away from my subject, as it always does when I stop to
reflect upon the anomalies of this social system we are living under. My
thoughts run 'a seachrán', as my father used to say when he would set me
to do ten minutes work and find me an hour after sitting, dreaming with
the job not yet commenced.

The first sign of progress I wish to note is the formation of the new
organization in Ireland whose program will be found on another page --
The Irish National Union of Workers. I have as yet no definite
information about the persons who drafted that program as I have seen
none of their names except that of their secretary, Councillor P.T.
Daly, therefore I am judging only from my knowledge of the labor
situation in Ireland when I hail that movement with pleasure.

I know P.T. Daly personally. He is a young man, a compositor by trade,
and with an absolutely clean record. His first participation in public
life was as a speaker at meetings in connection with the Old Guard
Benevolent Union, an organization of veterans of the Fenian movement,
and of those who subscribed to the principles of that movement.

Most of the members of this body were earnest whole-souled enthusiasts,
but quite a few, especially those who joined during the Centenary
Celebrations of the Rebellion of 1798, were wire-pullers who desired to
use the Old Guard for personal purposes. I have always classed Daly
among the former number.

Fortunately for him he had read most of the literature sold by the Irish
Socialist Republican Party, and all of the literature published under
the authority of, and by that body. In fact as a compositor he had
helped to set it up, as it was printed to a great extent in the shop
where he was employed. Such reading helped, no doubt, to steady him at a
time when much foolish matter about the 'union of classes' was being
preached in Ireland.

Since then he has become a Sinn Féiner, been elected to the Dublin City
Council, and has always, so far as we know, lined up on the right side.

Hence whilst it is more than possible that we do not see eye to eye with
the new movement in all things we hail it with delight for two reasons:
First, Whilst unmistakably Socialist it is unquestionably Irish; Second,
It is in honest hands.

A bit of Irish history is apropos. The Irish Local Government Act of
1899 first gave the Irish workers the right to vote in municipal
affairs. Immediately upon the passage of this act the Trade and Labor
Associations all over Ireland formed bodies for the purpose of
contesting municipal elections in the interests of labor. When the
elections came these bodies under the name of Labor Electoral
Associations contested everywhere against the nominees of the Home Rule
and Conservative parties.

The result was surprising. The success of the Labor Electoral
Associations was only limited by their own lack of courage. Everywhere
the Irish working-class had rallied to the standard of labor and elected
their men with surprising majorities. Conservatives and Home Rulers
alike went down in defeat not only in the large cities, but in small
urban constituencies as well.

In most places practically the whole ticket was elected, and in the city
of Limerick the labor men obtained a majority in the City Council,
electing the mayor.

It was a moment full of promise for the Irish Labor movement. Had the
men elected been men with a true understanding of the situation, had
they understood their class position in society, or even been as
responsive to the class spirit as the men and women who elected them
(for even the women had votes), or had they even grasped the fact that
as they were elected in defiance of the opposition of the Irish
capitalist politicians they should respond to the will of their
supporters by remaining an independent party, the whole history of
Ireland during those few years would have been altered for the better.

But they were for the most part weaklings like Alderman Fleming of the
North Dock Ward in Dublin, or ignorant spouters like Alderman Kelleher
of Cork, and knew no better than to form alliances with the old time
politicians. As a result they disgusted their own supporters, and their
actions on the City Councils stemmed the tide of Labor instead of
clearing the way for its progress.

In the midst of this upheaval the Irish Socialist Republican Party, the
only organised body of Socialists in the country who stood for the
Marxist doctrines as understood by International Socialism, could not
remain passive if it would be true to its mission. It was however in the
position where a false step would have done incalculable harm to the
revolutionary cause.

It made no false steps. On the launching of the Labor Electoral
Association it recognized that although that body was by no means
Socialistic it was a spontaneous manifestation of the class spirit on
the part of the Irish workers, and therefore worthy of encouragement and
support. Accordingly its speakers and its paper, the **Workers'
Republic**, vehemently urged the election of the candidates of the Labor
Electoral Association.

When, after election, the representatives of that body proved unworthy
of their trust the Irish Socialists regretfully, but firmly opposed
them. And when in following elections the same body abandoning their
former independent attitude formed alliances with capitalist parties of
Home Rulers and Unionists the Socialists were unsparing and effective in
their denunciation.

This was not inconsistency. It was in conformity with the duty of the
Socialist as laid down in the **Communist Manifesto**, that we must not
be a sect standing apart from the general labor movement, but be instead
a part of the movement, that part which comprehends the whole line of
march, in the midst of the interests of the moment takes care of the
interests of the whole, and pushes on all other sections of the working
class.

This requires encouragement where encouragement is desired, and
opposition and censure where opposition and censure are deserved.

I have no authority to speak for Socialists in Ireland to-day, but I
believe that they will meet the new movement in the same spirit. Unlike
the Labor Electoral Association this new movement is organized in
harmony with the central principle of Socialism -- the achievement of
common ownership in the means of life by and through the organized
working class; unlike the mere political Socialist it recognizes
seemingly the absolute necessity of combining the economic and political
organizations of labor, and in a true spirit of constructive revolution
it depends upon the development of the class feeling amongst its members
to clarify any obscurity or rectify any omission in its present program.

That is one good sign of progress.

Here is another. As you all know by this time Spailpín is unequivocally
a proletarian Socialist, and would rather depend upon the class
instincts of the man in the workshop than upon the knowledge of those
estimable Socialist men and women who belong to the classes who live
upon our labor. Indeed the wisest of these 'intellectuals' are of a
similar mind upon that matter.

When Marx had to choose between throwing in his lot with the
intellectuals of the Socialist sects of his time, or with the rough men
and women with whom he formed the International he unhesitatingly chose
the latter. He did so even although the intellectuals at least
understood the workings of capitalist society and were able to analyse
it, and the working class Internationalists were not.

He knew that once their feet were set upon the right track all the
instincts of the working class would lead them aright, and that their
material interests would co-operate in the good work. Time has proven
his wisdom on this point.

But much as I insist upon the working class as the prime factor, even
although a correspondent recently called me an intellectual, yet I hope
I will never make the mistake of overlooking or slighting the value of
the co-operation of the really educated classes in the work of
Socialism.

I want all the intellectual Socialists whom we can get but I have little
use for the Socialist intellectual. Now that is a cryptic saying you can
ponder over while I am trying to work in the next paragraphs.

Read carefully this chunk of wisdom. If you found it as hard to read as
I did to formulate you would either value it highly or -- not read it at
all.

The decadence of capitalist society is evidenced on every field in which
human thought expresses itself; it is seen in the trend of science, in
the uprooting of all old beliefs, customs and orthodoxies, in the
shakings and readjustments of religious doctrines to suit the new
conditions, as is illustrated in the Christian Socialism of
Protestantism and the Modernism of Catholicism, it is evidenced in
literature, art, and the drama, and in each and every case in which such
manifestation comes within the ken of a Socialist it is his duty to
recognize the good work that may be in it without abandoning his own
view point.

Capitalist society is like an old barrel which has been packed to the
rim with unfermented yeast; as soon as the yeast begins to ferment and
swell it will burst the old barrel and come streaming out in every
direction between the hoops. He is a fool who hails the yeast running to
waste as Socialism, he is a greater fool who denounces the activity of
the yeast as a capitalist trick; the wise man is he who hails it as a
sign of the new life stirring within and breaking through the old
environment. The new life will take care of itself obedient to the laws
of its creation.

Well, why this thusness? This is apropos of many things. More
particularly is it apropos of and an introduction to the following
speech of Mr W.B. Yeats in Dublin. Mr Yeats about 4 years ago made a
tour of the colleges and intellectual centers of the United States on
behalf of the Irish Literary Revival and was everywhere honored and
feted. He is an intellectual Irishman, poet, author of many plays, and a
son of the Yeats whose fulsome flattery of our race aroused my ire some
months ago. Here is what he says of the Irish bourgeoisie -- the
capitalist class of Ireland:

> "Ireland at the moment," he said, "is running the danger of
> surrendering her soul to the bourgeoisie, and to a worse bourgeoisie
> than ever fought in France -- to an ignorant, undisciplined
> bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie of France was disciplined, and it had
> great qualities. If they were to make the people great, the first to
> be fought was the bourgeoisie, so that the latter might get
> disciplined. They, artists, stood not for some pleasure, but for the
> laborious, disciplined soul, because all fine art -- everywhere in
> which there was a personal quality -- was the result of long labor.
> Art for art's sake was an intolerable toil. Any man could make himself
> popular if he took a few moral sayings, a few conventional moral
> platitudes, and put them into pictures, verses or stories. But such a
> man would be forgotten in ten years, although during that ten years he
> would be popular and would gain wealth. In art and literature the
> unconventional always seemed the immoral, because it was not the
> accustomed. It was easy for a man with his mouth full of commonplaces
> to sail to popularity. The bourgeoisie of Ireland, being undisciplined
> and untrained, were, therefore, essentially immoral. At this moment
> this bourgeoisie were attacking every artist who was sincere, or who
> was doing unconventional work, and in doing that it was merely doing
> what everyone said it would do, and what every bourgeoisie had done in
> this world for the last 200 years."

My hand goes out to W.B. Yeats. Also my memory goes back to a certain
quiet but earnest discussion in which Miss Maud Gonne, Mr W.B. Yeats and
your humble servant were the sole participants in the lady's reception
room in a hotel in Nassau Street, Dublin, when Mr Yeats was urging the
necessity of a union of classes, even to the extent of inviting
loyalists to join the '98 Executive Committee, and, remembering all
that, it seems to me that the speech just quoted shows progress and a
better appreciation of the forces that make for or against the uplifting
of the human race.

Certainly the intellectuals of Ireland are beginning to see a great
light. It is not so long since it would have been impossible to find an
Irish Scholar who would admit the essential bond between the language
and industry of a people, or rather the dependence of the former upon
the latter. In the **Workers' Republic** I once pointed out to some of
my Gaelic friends that capitalism was their real enemy, that for 600
years Irish had withstood every attempt of England to uproot it by force
of arms from its place as a spoken tongue, and that it was only when
English goods invaded the Irish market that the Irish tongue gave way.
As I said, "the cheapness of English products paved the way for the
introduction of English speech."

This is or was the application to Irish history of the Socialist
position that the economic conditions of society -- the social system --
are the determining factor in shaping history. Now here comes one of our
greatest Gaelic scholars, Eoin Mac Néill, and in an article in the
Gaelic monthly magazine, **Irisleabhar na Gaedhilge**, attacks his
fellow Gaels for their neglect of this point, and for their dependence
upon tradition to restore Gaelic to its place in Irish life, instead of
applying themselves to show it to be adaptable to the needs of modern
industrial life.

I remember that some years ago a Cork priest urged in favor of Gaelic
that it was full of reverent phrases, and was suitable and moulded to
holy expressions whereas English was the language of unbelief. The poor
sagart did not seem to realise that he was really arguing that Irish was
unfit to express certain forms of thought. If this were true it would
have been an argument against Irish not for it.

I quote a part of Eoin Mac Néill's article and wonder if he realises
that his appreciation of the essential truths of Socialism has enabled
him to see this deduction from Socialist premises. It is a long article,
but you can tell your good lady that you are better employing your time
reading this than trying to drink a brewery out of business.

All these things are signs of progress. They show that Socialist
philosophy is conquering the mind of the world.

In my notes last month I challenged the **Gaelic American** to give an
account of the suppression of the **Peasant** by Cardinal Logue, apropos
of the visit of His Eminence to this country. The day after the
publication of the **Harp** I received a marked copy of the **Gaelic
American** of the issue of January 19, 1907, in which a full account of
the matter appeared. The person who so kindly sent me the paper
misunderstood me if he believed that I doubted the willingness of the
**Gaelic American** to expose such a matter 3,000 miles away from the
scene of action. What I did mean to convey was that, as the Cardinal had
honored us with a visit, an exposure of his dictatorial action in the
past, if made now, would do more to make him and his like realise that
clerical oppression was a two edged weapon to use than would any amount
of newspaper exposure which did not interfere with his plans.

"The price of liberty is eternal vigilance", and the liberty of the
press can best be safeguarded by making its enemies realize that they
are apt to be struck at and punished in the moment that they least
expect or desire it.

Now that Cardinal Logue is here a concerted press campaign against him
for his action against the **Irish Peasant** would be a lesson his cloth
would take seriously to heart, and never forget.

Well, well, my notes this month have covered a wide range! It is another
proof of the wide spread range of Socialist influence. Perhaps also it
will serve to convince you that there are more things in Socialist
philosophy than you dreamed of before. If it does it will help to
satisfy

SPAILPÍN.
