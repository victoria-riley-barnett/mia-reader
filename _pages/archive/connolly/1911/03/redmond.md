In endeavouring to give readers in Great Britain some real conception of
the realities of Irish political life, one finds the task of explanation
made increasingly difficult by the spectacular nature of the campaign
waged by the Redmondites on the one hand, and the reactionary, lying
stupidities of the Irish Tories on the other. The fact that national
political freedom is both desirable and necessary blinds many people to
the truth that the advocates of such freedom on the political field may
be most intensely conservative on the social or economic field and,
indeed, may be purblind bigots in their opposition to all other
movements making for human progress or enlightenment.

On the other hand there are not wanting, even among Socialists, many who
seeing the socially reactionary character of much of the agitation for
national freedom, became opposed to the principle because of the
anti-Socialist character of some of its advocates.

The Socialist Party of Ireland avoids the dangers of either course. It
recognises that national political freedom is an inevitable step towards
the attainment of universal economic freedom, but it insists that the
non-Socialist leaders of merely national movements should be regarded in
their true light as champions of the old social order and not exalted
into the position of popular heroes by any aid of Socialist praise or
glorification. A fact many of our British comrades are apt to forget.

We need not beslaver the United Irish League because we detest the
Tories. We can detest them both. In fact they represent the same
principle in different stages of social development. The Tories are the
conservatives of Irish feudalism, the United Irish Leaguers are the
conservatives of a belated Irish capitalism. It is our business to help
the latter against the former only when we can do so without prejudice
to our own integrity as a movement.

How difficult this becomes, at times, is best illustrated by the
position of Mr. John E. Redmond, M.P., "Leader of the Irish race", as
his followers enthusiastically assure us. Mr. Redmond has a record as a
reactionist difficult to excel. Long before the Parnell split, he
denounced the Irish agricultural labourers in a speech at Rathfarnham,
near Dublin, for forming a trade union to protect their own interests.
On the granting of Local Government in 1898, a measure that first
enfranchised the Irish working class on local bodies, Mr. Redmond made a
speech counselling the labourers to elect landlords to represent them --
a speech truly characterised by Mr. Michael Davitt in the House of
Commons as the "speech of a half-emancipated slave". The labourers in
town and country treated Mr. Redmond's advice with contempt and elected
men of their own class all over Ireland. Compelled by the imperative
necessity of maintaining in power a Home Rule government, Mr. Redmond
votes for every measure of social reform the defeat of which would lead
to the resignation of said government, but quietly acquiesces in every
exemption of Ireland from progressive measures. Mr. Redmond believes
that the Irish people are capable of governing their country, but
opposed the proposal of Mr. T.W. Russell to allow the Irish people to
control their own schools under the Local Government Act of 1898. Mr.
Redmond bewails the fact that lack of employment compels the Irish
workers to emigrate at the rate of 30,000 per year, but opposed the
attempt of the Labour party to compel the government to recognise its
duty to provide work for them at home; Mr. Redmond believes that all
public servants and representatives should be paid for their services to
the State from the funds of the state, but is opposed to payment of
members being extended to Ireland; Mr. Redmond's heart bleeds for the
poor of Ireland, but he would not vote for the Feeding of School
Children's Act to be applied to Ireland, and Mr. Redmond is a friend of
the Labour party in England (!), but his party fights to the death
against every independent candidature of Labour throughout the purely
Nationalist districts of Ireland.

If we are, as we are, capable of running our own country, how comes it
we are not fit to be trusted with our own schools? And if the public
control of schools by the Catholic Irish people would lead to atheism
and to the persecution of the clergy, how has it not produced the same
effect in Canada which Mr. Redmond is continually praising as an example
for Ireland? Here is what a clergyman, the Rev. J.E. Burke, in a recent
speech in the Assembly Hall, Belfast, said of the educational system of
Canada -- that country so beloved of Mr. T.P. O'Connor and Mr. Redmond:

> They had no church schools -- nothing but state schools. While the
> priest and the parson were at liberty to visit the schools and give
> advice and encouragement, they had nothing to do in the management.
> The children of all nationalities and all creeds and classes attended
> these schools and grew up together in them, and he believed that the
> result of this was a better understanding amongst them in after life.

Mr. Redmond exalts Canada as a model for Irish Government, but opposes
in Ireland all these domestic institutions which make free government a
success in Canada.

If it was right, as it undoubtedly was, to demand aid for Irish farmers,
why is it not equally right to demand state aid or local aid for
starving Irish school children?

If, as Mr. Redmond claims, Ireland is overtaxed to the extent of over
two millions per year, how will payment of Irish members of Parliament
be a gift from the 'British' Treasury? Does one feel like the recipient
of a 'gift' when you get back some of your own?

How then does Mr. Redmond and his party maintain their hold despite
their essentially reactionary position? Simply because the Irish
Unionists are still more reactionary. It is almost a choice between the
devil and the deep sea.

Observe: In the debate in the House of Commons on the M'Cann case, Mr.
Joseph Devlin, M.P., taunted the Orange bigots with the fact that none
of their clergymen had been on the Anti-Sweating platform in the Ulster
Hall, Belfast. As a matter of fact, the same was true of the Catholic
clergymen. None of them were on that platform either, but the stupid
Orange reactionaries could not think of a better answer to Joe than to
deny the fact of the sweating. The obvious retort was apparently beyond
their capacities.

Another illustration: In the debate upon the issue of the writ for North
Louth, an Orange member, Mr. William Moore, moved to suspend the issue
of the writ for four months on the ground that 'Protestants' had been
assaulted. This motion was made despite the fact that the whole trend of
the evidence had been to prove that every species of intimidation and
bribery had been brought to bear upon Catholics who refused to bow to
the dictates of the official Home Rule gang. That, in short, it was
Catholics who needed to be protected and not Protestants.

A motion to suspend the issue of the writ pending a Parliamentary
investigation into the workings of the organisations responsible for the
wholesale terrorism exercised upon the electors of North Louth --
irrespective of religion -- would have opened the way for a capable man
to give such an exposure of the workings of the Ancient Order of
Hibernians (Board of Erin) and its relation to the United Irish League,
as might have led to the extirpation of that pest in Ireland, but no one
could expect such *statesmanship* from the Orange quarter.

But just imagine what a real Irish democrat could have made of such a
situation! Then he could have dealt with the pilgrimage of the M.P.'s to
America and Canada to beg from Irish exiles money towards the Irish
cause, how our exiled brothers and sisters stinted themselves of,
perhaps, even the necessaries of life in order to help to "free Ireland
and uplift poor Mother Erin", and how the money thus procured was used
to debauch Irish men and women, to destroy political purity, to purchase
bludgeons to smash in the heads of Irish men, and to terrorise the
peaceful countryside?

A real representative of the Irish democracy might go on to show how Mr.
Joseph Devlin's organisation, the A.O.H., supposed to be the Ancient
Order of Hibernians, but by some believed to be the Ancient Order of
Hooligans, has spread like an ulcer throughout Ireland, carrying social
and religious terrorism with it into quarters hitherto noted for their
broad-mindedness and discernment.

How it has organised the ignorant, the drunken and the rowdy, and thrown
the shield of religion around their excesses; how it has made it
impossible to conduct a political contest in the South of Ireland except
on the lines of civil war; and how, every man who dares to oppose the
Redmondite party, or every man within that party who opposes the A.O.H.,
must be at all times prepared to take his life in his hands \...

Every shade of political feeling in Ireland, outside of the official
gang at the head of the United Irish League, agree that this
organisation of Mr. Devlin's creation, and of whose work Mr. Redmond
accepts the fruits, is the greatest curse yet introduced into the
political and social like of Ireland. It is the organised ignorance of
the community placing itself unreservedly at the disposal of the most
insidious and inveterate enemies of enlightenment. In West Belfast it
calls upon the Labour vote, upon the Socialists, to vote for 'Wee Joe
Devlin', and in Queenstown [\[1\]](#n1){#f1} it foments a riot in order
to prevent a Socialist speaker delivering his message; it is a true
reincarnation of mediaeval intolerance masquerading in the guise of
Christian charity \...

Such is the problem, or rather some factors in the problem, in Ireland.
Say, ye British Socialists, have your leaders any conception of this
problem, or do they imagine that an Irish branch of a British Socialist
organisation can grapple with this problem, or do anything with it save
make a mess of it?

Or that it can be grappled with in any manner save from within the Irish
nation by the workers of Ireland uniting in a party of their own to
throw off the incubus of social slavery and religious intolerance? Such
is the work the Socialist Party of Ireland sets out to accomplish. In
that work the Socialists of Ireland know well that they can expect no
help or countenance from the bigots of either Green or Orange
persuasion, and while ever insisting upon the right of Ireland to
control its own destinies, it allows precedence in its thoughts and
plans to no interest but one, that of the working class. To the Redmonds
and the Devlins, the Carsons and the Moores -- it leaves the apostleship
of religious bigotry; in our ranks there is no room for that type of
politician of whom the poet writes that:--

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| With all his conscience and with one eye askew,\                      |
| So false he partly took himself for true;\                            |
| Whose pious talk, when most his heart was dry.\                       |
| Made wet the crafty crow's-foot round his eye;\                       |
| Who never naming God except for gain,\                                |
| So never took that useful name in vain;\                              |
| Made Him his cat's paw, and the Cross his tool,\                      |
| And Christ his bait to trap his dupe and fool;\                       |
| Nor deeds of gift, but gifts of grace, he forged,\                    |
| And, snakelike, slimed his victim ere he gorged.                      |
