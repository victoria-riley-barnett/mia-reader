The above extract from the manifesto of Ulster Liberal Protestants,
issued on 5th December, 1910, will serve as a text for my article this
week. I would especially direct the attention of the thoughtful reader
to the opening phrase in the quotation. *"For nearly a century the
question of Home Government has barred with triple steel every door of
progress."* How true this is every one acquainted with the inner life of
Ireland -- its civic and social life as distinguished from its political
partisanship -- can testify. Ireland is a land of contradictions. Just
as it is true that the perfervid orators of the United Irish League, who
screech most vehemently for national freedom are in domestic affairs in
Ireland the allies and champions of social reaction, and the enemies of
intellectual freedom, so also it is true that true blue loyalist
leaders, who on every platform assert their unquenchable enthusiasm for
the cause of Protestant liberty, are the slimiest enemies of the social
advancement of the Protestant working class. It may be news to some of
your readers, but it is an undoubted fact that the Catholic labourers in
the Catholic districts of Ulster reap the advantage of the Acts
empowering Boards of Guardians to erect labourers' cottages to a degree
far in excess of any advantage given to the Protestant agricultural
labourers in the Protestant districts. The enemies of Home Rule and
Popery are, it appears, also enemies of low rents and sanitary cottages
for their labourers. Where his mind is not obsessed with the fear of
compromising the national demand, the Irish Catholic labourer seems to
be enough of a democrat to insist upon his social rights as against his
Catholic employer or representative; but his Protestant fellow-worker in
the north seemingly allows a blatant parade of loyalty to "our
Protestant institutions" to compensate for all manner of treachery to
the cause of labour.

I have pointed out before that the harmless Act to empower a public
provision for the feeding of necessitous school children was kept out of
Ireland with the connivance -- if not directly at the desire -- of the
Home Rule Party. Let me add that the Ulster beaters of the Orange drum
were equally guilty in that respect. Public meetings to demand the
application of this Act to Ireland have already been held in Dublin and
Cork. The Dublin Trades' Council has acted, a general committee composed
of representatives from the Socialist Party of Ireland, the Daughters of
Erin, and the Trades Council have held a public meeting in the Mansion
House in furtherance of this object, and induced the Lord Mayor of the
city to preside in person; and the Dublin Corporation have unanimously
passed a resolution calling for this Act for Ireland. But Belfast and
'Derry have not moved, the Orange orators are too busy dancing imaginary
war dances on the banks of the Boyne to trouble about the starving
children of Belfast, or of the city by the Foyle.

The Corporation of Catholic Cork granted me the use of their City Hall
for a public meeting for this purpose, as have also the Urban District
Council at Queenstown. But the cries of the starving children of Ulster
cannot pierce the loyal ears attuned to the after-dinner oratorical
efforts of Mr. McMordie, or the poisonous, religious, rancorous ravings
of Sir Edward Carson.

But perhaps it will be argued that the prosperity of Belfast is so great
that such an Act would be quite unnecessary, and did not Mr. McMordie
rise in his place in the House of Commons and work in a free
advertisement for workers in the linen trade of that city, by telling of
the great demand for workers there, and of its great and abundant
prosperity. I extract from the **Belfast Newsletter**, a rabidly
loyalist paper, of September 8, 1910, the following short report of a
speech delivered in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, by Miss Mary Galway,
Secretary of the Millworkers, on the conditions of sweated outworkers in
the linen industry in Belfast. It shows how the Godly Protestant
employers of Belfast sweat and rob the Godly Protestant workers, and how
zeal for the Empire is made a cloak to trick out a mad desire to amass
wealth by grinding the faces of the poor:

> "Miss Galway then displayed samples of the work done in the home, and
> gave figures regarding the rate of pay. She said for clipping cotton
> pocket handkerchiefs with 120 clips on each a sum of 1d. per dozen was
> paid, and it took an expert worker five hours to clip twelve dozen.
> For threaddrawing pure linen handkerchiefs supplied by one of the best
> and oldest firms in the city, 1d. per dozen was paid, and six dozen
> could be drawn in one hard day's work. A widow with seven children
> could earn at most 4/- per week at hand-spoke work, the rate of
> payment being 1/3 per dozen handkerchiefs. For clipping the threads on
> an elaborately embroidered bedspread, 88 ins. by 100 ins., 3/4d. was
> paid, and it took fully an hour to do that work. Another woman was
> engaged three long days embroidering a linen teacloth, 45 ins. by 43
> ins., for which she was paid 8d. Thread-drawing of pillow-cases was
> paid at the rate of 4d. per dozen, and four could be done in an hour.
> On a cotton handkerchief there were 112 dots, and the worker was paid
> 6d. per dozen handerchiefs, while at shirtmaking an expert worker
> could earn about 1/3 in fourteen hours. She could quote other
> instances showing the long hours and wretched pay of these workers,
> and yet they were asked was there any sweating?"

Since then, in answer to his unctuous self-congratulations in
Parliament, Miss Galway has challenged Mr. M'Mordie, M.P., to take a
walk with her to houses within fifteen minutes of the Belfast City Hall,
and she would show him still more outrageous cases of sweating; but no
acceptance is yet forthcoming.

But when election time rolls around, the smug representative of
orangeism will beat the big drum of *"saving the union"* before the
working class voters, and with that discord in their ears they will be
deaf to the cry of the helpless victims of capitalist oppression.

Oh, words of burning truth! *"For nearly a century the question of Home
Government has barred with triple steel every door of progress!"*

The question of Home Government, the professional advocacy of it, and
the professional opposition to it, is the greatest asset in the hands of
reaction in Ireland, the never-failing decoy to lure the workers into
the bogs of religious hatreds and social stagnation.

The Protestant workers of Belfast are essentially democratic in their
instincts, but not a single Belfast loyalist M.P. voted for the Old Age
Pensions' Act. The loyalist M.P.s knew that the beating of the orange
drum would drown every protest within their constituencies.

The development of democracy in Ireland has been smothered by the Union.
Remove that barrier, throw the Irish people back upon their own
resources, make them realise that the causes of poverty, of lack of
progress, of arrested civic and national development, are then to be
sought for within and not without, are in their power to remove or
perpetuate, and ere long that spirit of democratic progress will invade
and permeate all our social and civic institutions.

Believing that that day is approaching, the Socialist Party of Ireland
seeks to prepare for it by laying now the foundations of that socialist
movement, whose duty it will be to guide and direct the efforts of
labour in Ireland, to find and fashion a proper channel of expression
and instrument of emancipation.

That labour movement of the future, as well as the socialist movement of
today must, indeed, draw inspiration from the successes of our comrades
abroad, but must also shape its course to suit the conditions within our
own shores.

The Socialist Party of Ireland recognises and most enthusiastically
endorses the principle of internationalism, but it realises that that
principle must be sought through the medium of universal brotherhood
rather than by self-extinction of distinct nations within the political
maw of over-grown Empires.

When once all the socialists in Ireland recognise this principle, and
unite with us, they will have cause to wonder at the readiness with
which the workers of Ireland will respond to the socialist appeal.

If all the socialists in Ireland who waste their time in cursing the
unprogressiveness of the Irish workers, had only sufficient moral
courage to declare themselves, they would be astonished at the multitude
of their numbers, and would then realise that they were strong enough to
ensure respect and toleration.

Until they do, we will be compelled to see Irish Tory employers hiding
their sweatshops behind orange flags, and Irish home rule landlords
using the green sunburst of Erin to cloak their rackrenting in the
festering slums of our Irish towns.
