### Introductory Note

In the May 27th, 1911 edition of the socialist paper, **Forward**, James
Connolly, as organiser for the Socialist Party of Ireland, made an
appeal to the members of the Independent Labour Party (Belfast Area),
for socialist unity in Ireland. His appeal envoked a reply from Belfast
I.L.P. leader, William Walker, and a bitter controversy ensued until it
was stopped by the editor. This pamphlet is an unabridged record of the
controversy between Connolly and Walker which was published in
**Forward** between May 27th and July 8th, 1911. 16.8.2003
