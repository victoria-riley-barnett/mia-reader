# Visit of King George V

### (1910)

Fellow-Workers,

As you are aware from reading the daily and weekly newspapers, we are
about to be blessed with a visit from King George V.

Knowing from previous experience of Royal Visits, as well as from the
Coronation orgies of the past few weeks, that the occasion will be
utilised to make propaganda on behalf of royalty and aristocracy against
the oncoming forces of democracy and National freedom, we desire to
place before you some few reasons why you should unanimously refuse to
countenance this visit, or to recognise it by your presence at its
attendant processions or demonstrations. We appeal to you as workers,
speaking to workers, whether your work be that of the brain or of the
hand -- manual or mental toil -- it is of you and your children we are
thinking; it is your cause we wish to safeguard and foster.

The future of the working class requires that all political and social
positions should be open to all men and women; that all privileges of
birth or wealth be abolished, and that every man or woman born into this
land should have an equal opportunity to attain to the proudest position
in the land. The Socialist demands that the only birthright necessary to
qualify for public office should be the birthright of our common
humanity.

Believing as we do that there is nothing on earth more sacred than
humanity, we deny all allegiance to this institution of royalty, and
hence we can only regard the visit of the King as adding fresh fuel to
the fire of hatred with which we regard the plundering institutions of
which he is the representative. Let the capitalist and landlord class
flock to exalt him; he is theirs; in him they see embodied the idea of
caste and class; they glorify him and exalt his importance that they
might familiarise the public mind with the conception of political
inequality, knowing well that a people mentally poisoned by the
adulation of royalty can never attain to that spirit of self-reliant
democracy necessary for the attainment of social freedom. The mind
accustomed to political kings can easily be reconciled to social kings
-- capitalist kings of the workshop, the mill, the railway, the ships
and the docks. Thus coronation and king\'s visits are by our astute
neversleeping masters made into huge Imperialist propagandist campaigns
in favour of political and social schemes against democracy. But if our
masters and rulers are sleepless in their schemes against us, so we,
rebels against their rule, must never sleep in our appeal to our fellows
to maintain as publicly our belief in the dignity of our class -- in the
ultimate sovereignty of those who labour.

What is monarchy? From whence does it derive its sanction? What has been
its gift to humanity? Monarchy is a survival of the tyranny imposed by
the hand of greed and treachery upon the human race in the darkest and
most ignorant days of our history. It derives its only sanction from the
sword of the marauder, and the helplessness of the producer, and its
gifts to humanity are unknown, save as they can be measured in the
pernicious examples of triumphant and shameless iniquities.

Every class in society save royalty, and especially British royalty, has
through some of its members contributed something to the elevation of
the race. But neither in science, nor in art, nor in literature, nor in
exploration, nor in mechanical invention, nor in humanising of laws, nor
in any sphere of human activity has a representative of British royalty
helped forward the moral, intellectual or material improvement of
mankind. But that royal family has opposed every forward move, fought
every reform, persecuted every patriot, and intrigued against every good
cause. Slandering every friend of the people, it has befriended every
oppressor. Eulogised today by misguided clerics, it has been notorious
in history for the revolting nature of its crimes. Murder, treachery,
adultery, incest, theft, perjury -- every crime known to man has been
committed by some one or other of the race of monarchs from whom King
George is proud to trace his descent.

| Has crept through scoundrels since the flood."                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

We will not blame him for the crimes of his ancestors if he relinquishes
the royal rights of his ancestors; but as long as he claims their
rights, by virtue of descent, then, by virtue of descent, he must
shoulder the responsibility for their crimes.

Fellow-workers, stand by the dignity of your class. All these parading
royalties, all this insolent aristocracy, all these grovelling,
dirt-eating capitalist traitors, all these are but signs of disease in
any social state -- diseases which a royal visit brings to a head and
spews in all its nastiness before our horrified eyes. But as the
recognition of the disease is the first stage towards its cure, so that
we may rid our social state of its political and social diseases, we
must recognise the elements of corruption. Hence, in bringing them all
together and exposing their unity, even a royal visit may help us to
understand and understanding, help us to know how to destroy the royal,
aristocratic and capitalistic classes who live upon our labour. Their
workshops, their lands, their mills, their factories, their ships, their
railways must be voted into our hands who alone use them, public
ownership must take the place of capitalist ownership, social democracy
replace political and social inequality, the sovereignty of labour must
supersede and destroy the sovereignty of birth and the monarchy of
capitalism.

Ours be the task to enlighten the ignorant among our class, to dissipate
and destroy the political and social superstitions of the enslaved
masses and to hasten the coming day when, in the words of Joseph Brenan,
the fearless patriot of '48, all the world will maintain
