In this little book Connolly challenges the nationalist myths about the
Irish struggle for freedom from British rule. Connolly's aim was to
convince the radical nationalists that their policy of a 'union of
classes' would lead to disaster. He argued that Irish independence would
bring little in the way of freedom and progress for the majority of the
Irish people unless it included a fundamental challenge to the structure
of society. He also shows graphically how the Irish capitalist class was
always prepared to abandon and betray the struggle for liberation if its
economic and social interests were threatened.

This book has become a classic not only because Connolly based his
argument on a detailed hisorical awccount of Ireland's struggle for
freedom -- an account bettered by few, if any, books since -- but also
because of its continued relevance to an Ireland still divided today.
