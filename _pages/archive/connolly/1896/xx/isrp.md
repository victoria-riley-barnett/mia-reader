LET US RISE.\"

#### OBJECT

Establishment of AN IRISH SOCIALIST REPUBLIC based upon the public
ownership by the Irish people of the land, and instruments of
production, distribution and exchange. Agriculture to be administered as
a public function, under boards of management elected by the
agricultural population and responsible to them and to the nation at
large. All other forms of labour necessary to the well-being of the
community to be conducted on the same principles.

 

#### PROGRAMME

As a means of organising the forces of the Democracy in preparation for
any struggle which may precede the realisation of our ideal, of paving
the way for its realisation, of restricting the tide of emigration by
providing employment at home, and finally of palliating the evils of our
present social system, we work by political means to secure the
following measures:

1.  Nationalisation of railways and canals.
2.  Abolition of private banks and money-lending institutions and
    establishments of state banks, under popularly elected boards of
    directors, issuing loans at cost.
3.  Establishment at public expense of rural depots for the most
    improved agricultural machinery, to be lent out to the agricultural
    population at a rent covering cost and management alone.
4.  Graduated income tax on all incomes over #400 per annum in order to
    provide funds for pensions to the aged, infirm and widows and
    orphans.
5.  Legislative restriction of hours of labour to 48 per week and
    establishment of a minimum wage.
6.  Free maintenance for all children.
7.  Gradual extension of the principle of public ownership and supply to
    all the necessaries of life.
8.  Public control and management of National schools by boards elected
    by popular ballot for that purpose alone.
9.  Free education up to the highest university grades.
10. Universal suffrage.

 

#### THE IRISH SOCIALIST REPUBLICAN PARTY

That the agricultural and industrial system of a free people, like their
political system, ought to be an accurate reflex of the democratic
principle by the people for the people, solely in the interests of the
people.

That the private ownership, by a class, of the land and instruments of
production, distribution and exchange, is opposed to this vital
principle of justice, and is the fundamental basis of all oppression,
national, political and social.

That the subjection of one nation to another, as of Ireland to the
authority of the British Crown, is a barrier to the free political and
economic development of the subjected nation, and can only serve the
interests of the exploiting classes of both nations.

That, therefore, the national and economic freedom of the Irish people
must be sought in the same direction, viz., the establishment of an
Irish Socialist Republic, and the consequent conversion of the means of
production, distribution and exchange into the common property of
society, to be held and controlled by a democratic state in the
interests of the entire community.

That the conquest by the Social Democracy of political power in
Parliament, and on all public bodies in Ireland, is the readiest and
most effective means whereby the revolutionary forces may be organised
and disciplined to attain that end.
