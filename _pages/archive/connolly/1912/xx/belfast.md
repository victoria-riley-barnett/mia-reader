Resolved: That this meeting of workingmen and women of Belfast welcomes
the project of the establishment of an Irish Parliament as opening the
way for much needed social reform and the reunion of the Irish democracy
hitherto divided upon antiquated sectarian lines, but considers that in
the interests of democracy in this country more facilities should be
offered for securing a full and proper representation of the people of
Ireland; and we, therefore, demand that provision be made in the Bill
for payment of members and election expenses, proportional
representation, and the enfranchisement of women; and also that the
proposed Senate be dropped from the Bill, as we consider that experience
has proven double chambers of legislature to be useless and dangerous.

That a copy of this resolution be sent to the leaders of the various
parties in Parliament, and also to the Parliamentary representatives of
Belfast.
