# An Exchange on Rome and Irish Catholics

### (1912)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This short, but heated exchange adds an interesting sidelight on
Connolly's attitude to religion in general, and to Catholicism in
particular. As such it is an important supplement to his other writings
on the topic, such as **Labour, Nationality and Religion**.
