| *There is a New Evangel\                                              |
|       At this moment preached in France\                              |
| And the priests of its great doctrines\                               |
|       Despise the tyrant's glance;\                                   |
| Oh, that Holy Gospel echoes\                                          |
|       From distant sea to sea!\                                       |
| It teaches Men are Brothers,\                                         |
|       It teaches all are Free!*                                       |
|                                                                       |

| "Ireland as distinct from her people, is nothing to me: and the man   |
| who is bubbling over with love and enthusiasm for Ireland, and can    |
| yet pass unmoved through our streets and witness all the wrong and    |
| the suffering, the shame and the degradation brought upon the people  |
| of Ireland -- aye, brought by Irishmen upon Irishmen and women,       |
| without burning to end it, is in my opinion, a fraud and a liar in    |
| his heart, no matter how he loves that combination of chemical        |
| elements he is pleased to call Ireland."                              |
