Memo from Irish Socialist Republican Party.\
Central Branch.\
To: Sec. Edin. S.D.F. [\[1\]](#n1){#f1}\
1 November 1901.

Dear Comrade,

I am forwarding herewith a copy of the pamphlet part of this month's
**Workers' Republic**. The full paper will be delivered in a few days. I
must take this opportunity to congratulate you on the magnificent stand
made by the Scotch and more especially the Edinburgh comrades against
the present compromising policy of the leaders of the S.D.F. Things may
seem to look dangerous for you at present, but time is on your side, and
when the English branches really realise the issues at stake and
understand your position, the triumph will be yours. I speak with the
knowledge of who one having been all through England *knows* that the
only hope of the gang in power is to keep the English comrades ignorant.
The present issue of our paper is primarily intended to prevent that
hope being realised, by giving the large number of English branches who
now take our paper a more clear exposition of this question than
**Justice** has allowed them to have.

I only wish our paper was bigger or that our plant was more suitable for
rapid printing than it is at present, but we are poor and we are still
short of the cash necessary to supply us with a quick printing machine,
but such help as we have we will readily give to you.

I would only say in conclusion to beware of all dodges and devices to
drive you out of the S.D.F. Help in the organisation, do not be
brow-beaten, nor get disgusted; for the sake of those who are in remain
in also, and sooner or later you will find your policy tacitly adopted
by the whole body even if they do not admit their indebtedness to you.
