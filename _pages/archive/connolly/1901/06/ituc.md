Temperance orators, in their desire to awaken in the minds of their
hearers a proper horror of the debasing effects of the liquor habit, are
fond of searching the records of the police courts for cases in which
crimes have been committed in the delirium of intoxication, and holding
up the criminals in such cases as "horrible examples". In the near
future the student of society who desires to find illustrations of the
debasing effects of a policy of compromise upon the minds of working
class leaders, or of the intoxicating effects upon the brain of a
formerly sensible man produced by the appearance of a body of reporters
ready to take down a verbatim copy of his speech for the newspapers of
their capitalist jury-masters -- such a student will instinctively turn
to the reports of Irish Trade Union Congresses, and so turning find
"horrible examples" in abundance.

The excerpt we print above from the speech of Mr Bowman, President of
the Trade Union Congress at Sligo, is a case in point. We are only
stating what every workman knows to be the fact when we say that the
delegates to Trade Union Congresses are, as a rule, not the flower of
the working class, but are rather the intriguers who, because they are
willing to perform (for a cash consideration) the drudgery and routine
work of trade unionism, are allowed by the too indulgent rank and file
to work themselves into positions of notoriety and to pose as leaders.
Yet as unintelligent and unimaginative as such delegates generally are,
we question if there were a dozen present at Sligo who did not feel that
the president's appeal to capitalists to come and exploit the Irish
workers -- for that, stripped of all its tawdry rhetoric, is what Mr
Bowman's address meant -- an appeal coupled with the assurance that
Irish workers could make "Irish investments remunerative", i.e. could
make good, fat profit for their master -- was an appeal which was to the
last degree insulting and humiliating to the working class of this
country.

A Socialist in the position of Mr Bowman would have striven to infuse
into the minds of his hearers a spirit of revolt against the system that
holds them as its slaves, a system that tortures them with want in the
midst of locked-up storehouses of plenty; a Socialist would have taught
the workers to manfully take their destiny, politically and socially,
into their own hands; Mr Bowman taught them to whine for capitalists to
come and exploit them. The wage received by 87 per cent of the wage
workers of Ireland is less than £1 per week; Mr Bowman tells them to
achieve the industrial regeneration of Ireland by establishing "people's
banks" out of their savings!!! Out of the savings of men who support a
family on less than £1 per week?? This is what the capitalist **Evening
Herald** termed a "splendid statement".

We do not grudge Mr Bowman the praise of the capitalist newspapers; he
has fairly earned it, fairly earned the praise of the journalistic
champions of the master class. But there were some Socialists, we
believe, amongst the delegates to that Congress and we mean to have an
explanation of their silence on that occasion. Were they afraid that
they also might be accused of personal enmity to the president if they
dared to criticise him? If they were, it is not of such stuff
revolutionists are made.
