Socialists are always accused of trying to create ill feeling, to bring
about a class struggle, to "set class against class". Of course, the
real fact is, we only point out what already exists, analysing the
political and industrial institutions under which we live and critically
noting the forces which produce them in any given phase. The necessary
result of our analysis is to discover that the very basis of Society
today is a struggle between two classes, the Landlord and Capitalist who
own all the means of production, and the propertyless class who are only
allowed to use and operate these means of life when it suits the
convenience or interest of members of the other class to allow them.

The average worker has no clear, reasoned out knowledge of this, but he
has a more or less dim perception of the fact borne in upon his slow
intellect through the channel of his daily experience of the struggle
for life. His masters who are interested in keeping him in that
plentiful lack of knowledge are always careful to raise the cry "Capital
and labour are brothers" and don't "set class against class". Armed
thus, mentally, with the illogical rot preached to him by his fleecers
the "man in the street" regards the Socialist as, well -- perhaps right
enough, but rather "extreme". We Socialist workers who know the tricks
by which our fellows are deceived and kept in subjection are filled with
disgust, mingled with pity.

We have always proclaimed that, while the worker is not class-conscious
-- that is, knowing and understanding his class subjection and its
cause, and therefore knowing and understanding his class interest in
overthrowing the institutions which keep him so -- it is not so with the
landlord and capitalist. They, as a rule, are thoroughly class-conscious
and in all their measures never lose sight of the cardinal principle of
the class struggle. While the average worker makes a great show of
having nothing much to do with politics, the other class have calculated
to a nicety its exact value not merely to their whole class, but even to
each of their sections. All government is therefore class government;
and that the middle-class and aristocratic swindlers who hold the reins
of political power know it is amply proved by the following extracts
from speeches. Thus Lord Rosebery [\[1\]](#n1){#f1}, addressing the
Wolverhampton Chamber of Commerce:--

> "He was one of those who held chambers of commerce in the highest
> respect. In the first place they focussed the opinion of a great and
> governing class -- a class which had governed Great Britain in the
> past, and which he was not prepared to say did not govern it in the
> present."

But the Socialist is so extreme. He sets class against class.

Mr McNeill moved a resolution in the House of Commons condemning the
holding of company directorships by members of the government and Mr C.
Bannerman supported him. Thus spoke Mr Balfour in reply:

> "I do not profess to know in what the right honourable gentleman has
> his money invested, but, if he has it invested in anything in this
> country, there is scarcely a piece of legislation passed through this
> house that does not affect his interests either directly or
> indirectly." [\[2\]](#n2){#f2}

But the Socialist is so extreme. He talks of capitalist government.
