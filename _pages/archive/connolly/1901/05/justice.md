Dear Comrade,

I am glad to see that our friends of the staff of **Justice** are at
last beginning to realise the terrible mistake made when, out of a
mistaken tenderness for the feelings of M. Jaurès and party, they
refrained from voting their condemnation of the position of Millerand in
the French bourgeois Cabinet. In **Justice** of May 11 I find it stated
that "the presence of Millerand in the French Cabinet is an injury to
Socialism all over the world," and further on that it is "an
international scandal." These are grave statements, particularly grave
when we remember that the S.D.F. as part of the British delegation voted
against a resolution -- the Guesde-Ferri resolution -- which, if it had
been carried, might have prevented the scandal complained of.

The great difficulty in the way now, the difficulty with which the
International Socialist Council will find itself powerless to deal,
arises out of the circumstance that the Kautsky resolution declared the
acceptance and retention of such a position as that of Millerand to be
merely a matter of *tactics* and not of *principles*. As the Kautsky
resolution was carried even were the Socialist press of the world to
condemn Millerand, and were such condemnation to be endorsed by every
council, national and international, he (Millerand) could still
logically claim to be considered a good Socialist, differing only in
tactics from the Socialists of the world, who agreed with him in
principle. I would like to know how you are going to get out of the
difficulty in which you have placed yourself, except by repudiating the
Kautsky resolution and accepting the definite and uncompromising
resolution proposed against it, viz., that the revolutionary proletariat
should, through its delegates, accept no governmental position which it
cannot conquer by its own strength at the ballot box. I may be wrong,
but I am of opinion that the position taken up at Paris was opposed to
the whole traditions and policy of the S.D.F. In arriving at a clear
conception of the results flowing from that position it is well to
remember the Russian atrocities spoken of by JUSTICE, and, what seems to
me more important, that over a dozen strikes in France have been broken
by military force since Millerand entered the Cabinet. What good
Millerand may have done is claimed for the credit of the bourgeoise
Republican Cabinet; what evil the Cabinet has done reflects back upon
the reputation of the Socialist Party. Heads they win, tails we lose. --
Yours

\[A reference to the terms of the Kautsky resolution will show that it
condemns the continuance of a Socialist in a Ministry under such
circumstances as now obtain in Millerand's case. The entry of a
Socialist into a Government is certainly a question of tactics and not
of principle, but it is for the party and not the individual to decide
on the tactics. While condemning the continuance of Millerand in the
Ministry, therefore, we still stand by the Kautsky resolution, as we can
consistently do. -- *Ed.*\]
