# Father Finlay, S.J., and Socialism

### (1899)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

From **Workers' Republic**, July 1, 1899\
Transcribed by [*The James Connolly
Society*](http://www.wageslave.org/jcs/) in 1997.

> "Those who seek a comprehensive remedy for the sufferings of the
> working classes look beyond trades unionism. They perceive that they
> must modify more profoundly the relations between labour and capital;
> to bridge across the chasm dividing them, and so to abolish that
> rivalry of interest out of which has grown so much inhumanity to man.
> One class of reformers propose to effect this change by the absolute
> abolition of private capital -- by taking capital, or the material
> instruments of wealth production, out of the hands of the individuals
> and classes, and making it the property of the community, vesting it
> in the State. This scheme, a dream of the socialist -- impossible to
> work out in practice, hopelessly breaking down wherever it has been
> tried, violates the fundamental conception of all property. What a
> free man creates by his labour, that is his property; if it is his
> property he can do with it what he wills -- consume it by present use
> or reserve it for further production. To forbid him the right to
> reserve it or use it as capital would be to deny him the right to
> possess property. From this point of view -- as well as from others --
> socialism is seen to have much in common with slavery."

The above quotation, from the paper on *Cooperation* read by Father
Thomas A. Finlay, S.J., before the fourth general meeting of the
Maynooth union, calls for more than a passing notice, is deserving of
more intelligent criticism than our capitalist contemporaries have been
able to bring to bear upon it. For this reason we propose to place
before our readers a brief statement of our position in so far at least
as it is affected by the assertions contained in the paper quoted from
above.

We readily allow that no man in Ireland within the clerical body, and
few men in Ireland outside the ranks of the adherents of scientific
socialism, can bring to bear upon questions of political economy, and
the effect which theories of political economy have had upon the
industrial life of the people, such a wealth of knowledge as the
reverend gentleman whose paper we are now discussing. The feeble and
ineffective efforts of the Home Rule pressmen to criticise the
cooperative movement to which Father Finlay devotes so much of his
energy and ability is in itself proof enough that, however efficient our
journalistic guides may be as caterers to the palate of a reading public
ready to forgive every inconsistency of statement or colouring of fact,
if only it is seasoned with a dash of 'patriotism' or 'true religion,'
as helps to the intelligent discussion of an economic question they are
worse than useless.

The economic theories held by the non-socialist parties in Ireland today
and voiced by their publicists on press and platform, are in fact the
theories which prevailed in England more than fifty years ago -- during
the agitation for the repeal of the corn laws, and for free trade in
general. Such ideas are now regarded throughout the remainder of the
world as outworn and obsolete; it is only in Ireland they survive, and
in Ireland only among men, who having failed to keep step with the
intellectual march of the world, would fain convince themselves that the
intellectual incapacity which shuts them off from sympathy with the
thought of the age is the distinguishing birthmark of a true celt. That
the criticism of such persons should be of little effect in adding to
our knowledge any important truth on an economic subject is, of course,
to be expected, and we do not propose to waste our own or our readers'
time in discussing them. But the arguments of Father Finlay naturally
carry more weight, and deserve, we repeat, a much more serious study.

To begin with we would like to remind the reverend lecturer that he did
not place before his hearers such a dear and definite idea of the true
socialist position as he himself possesses. In a lecture delivered in
Dublin before the Statistical Society some few years ago, in dealing
with the teachings of Karl Marx -- the ablest exponent of socialism the
world has seen, and the founder of that school of thought which embraces
all the militant socialist parties of the world -- Father Finlay laid
before his hearers an exposition of the evolutionary nature of the
socialist doctrine, its historical derivation and materialistic basis,
which is not at all compatible with the crudely false conception of
socialism to be found in the foregoing quotation. Modern socialism, he
showed, is not the product of the brains of any man nor of any number of
men; it is the legitimate child of a long, drawn-out historical
evolution, and its consummation will only be finally possible when that
evolutionary process has attained to a suitable degree of development.
As capitalist society -- the system of wage-labour and 'free contract'
between master and man -- was only developed according as the system of
feudalism -- or serf labour under a hereditary landowning nobility --
broke down owing to the demand for new methods of industry produced by
the opening up of new markets through the discovery of America, and the
perfection of means of transit and communication, in like manner will
socialism also come when the development of capitalism in its turn
renders the burden of a capitalist class unbearable, and the capitalist
system unworkable.

Socialists point out that the capitalist system depends upon the
maintenance of an equilibrium between the producing and consuming powers
of the world; that business cannot go on unless the goods produced can
find customers; that owing to the rapid development of machinery this
equilibrium cannot be maintained; that the productive powers of the
world are continually increasing whilst the virgin markets of the world
are as continually diminishing; that every new scientific process
applied to industry, every new perfecting of machinery, increases the
productivity of labour, but as the area of the world remains unaltered
the hope of finding new markets for the products of labour grows ever
less and less; that a time must come when all the world will be
exhausted as a market for the wares of commerce, and yet invention and
industrial perfectioning remain as active as ever; that then capitalism
-- able to produce more in a few months than would supply its customers
for years -- will have no work for the workers who, constituting the
vast majority as they do, will have to choose between certain starvation
and revolt for socialism. That the same economic development which will
create the necessity for revolt will also provide the conditions
required to make that revolt successful, in so far as it will have
forced out of business the multitude of small capitalists, and replaced
them by huge Companies, Stores, and Trusts -- huge aggregations of
Capital under one head, a unification of industry, requiring only the
transference of the right of ownership from the individual to the
democratic community to bridge the chasm between capitalism and
socialism. That the private property which the worker should possess in
the fruits of his toil is continually confiscated today by the
capitalist process of industry, and that socialism by making all
citizens -- society -- joint heirs and owners of the tools of
production, will restore to the workers that private property of which
capitalism deprives them.

Here then is a statement of the aims and principles of modern socialism.
The intelligent reader will observe that this is not a mere piece of
speculative philosophy, nor yet the product of disordered brains acted
upon by hunger-weakened stomachs. On the contrary it is primarily a
scientific analysis of the past and present structure of society, a
comprehensive *summing up of the facts of history.*

In face of this fact, which we would most respectfully remind Father
Finlay he has himself most lucidly explained here now what becomes of
his statement at Maynooth that socialism had "hopelessly broken down
wherever it has been tried." The statement was crudely false,
mischievous, and misleading, and Father Finlay would not risk his
reputation by repeating it before any audience of scientists in the
world. That he thought it quite safe to make such an utterance at
Maynooth is an interesting indication of the low estimate in which he
held the intellectual grasp of his hearers on the thought of their
generation. Socialism has not "broken down wherever it has been tried,"
because, being the fruit of an historical evolution yet to be completed,
*it has never been tried.*

If Father Finlay can tell when and where such an industrial order as
would be recognised by the socialist parties of the world as socialism
has been tried and failed then we will publicly recant our errors.
Wanting such information we, and with us an ever-increasing band of the
wage-slaves of capitalism, will continue to prepare for that revolt
which shall establish the socialist republic.
