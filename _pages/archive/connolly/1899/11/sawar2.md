\... And what about the war? Well, I think it is the beginning of the
end. This great, blustering British Empire; this Empire of truculent
bullies, is rushing headlong to its doom. Whether they ultimately win or
lose, the Boers have pricked the bubble of England's fighting
reputation. The world knows her weakness now. Have at her, then
everywhere and always and in every manner. And before the first decade
of the coming century will close, you and I, if we survive, will be able
to repeat to our children the tale of how this monstrous tyranny sank in
dishonour and disaster.
