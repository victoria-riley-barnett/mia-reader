| Some men, faint-hearted, ever seek\                                   |
| Our programme to retouch,\                                            |
| And will insist, whene'er they speak\                                 |
| That we demand too much.\                                             |
| 'Tis passing strange, yet I declare\                                  |
| Such statements give me mirth,\                                       |
| For our demands most moderate are,\                                   |
| We only want the earth.                                               |
|                                                                       |
| "Be moderate," the trimmers cry,\                                     |
| Who dread the tyrants' thunder.\                                      |
| " You ask too much and people fly\                                    |
| From you aghast in wonder."\                                          |
| 'Tis passing strange, for I declare\                                  |
| Such statements give me mirth,\                                       |
| For our demands most moderate are,\                                   |
| We only want the earth.                                               |
|                                                                       |
| Our masters all a godly crew,\                                        |
| Whose hearts throb for the poor,\                                     |
| Their sympathies assure us, too,\                                     |
| If our demands were fewer.\                                           |
| Most generous souls! But please observe,\                             |
| What they enjoy from birth\                                           |
| Is all we ever had the nerve\                                         |
| To ask, that is, the earth.                                           |
|                                                                       |
| The "labour fakir" full of guile,\                                    |
| Base doctrine ever preaches,\                                         |
| And whilst he bleeds the rank and file\                               |
| Tame moderation teaches.\                                             |
| Yet, in despite, we'll see the day\                                   |
| When, with sword in its girth,\                                       |
| Labour shall march in war array\                                      |
| To realize its own, the earth.                                        |
|                                                                       |
| For labour long, with sighs and tears,\                               |
| To its oppressors knelt.\                                             |
| But never yet, to aught save fears,\                                  |
| Did the heart of tyrant melt.\                                        |
| We need not kneel, our cause is high\                                 |
| Of true men there\'s no dearth\                                       |
| And our victorious rallying cry\                                      |
| Shall be we want the earth!                                           |
