We have in Belfast a Home Rule journal, the **Irish News**, a careful
study of whose columns would be an enlightenment to those Socialist
comrades in Great Britain who imagine in their innocence that an
enthusiasm for Labour is the inevitable accompaniment of the advocacy of
a measure of political freedom for Ireland.

They would find that that journal is one of the most deadly enemies of
the Labour movement that this country possesses, and that it never lets
slip any opportunity to wound that movement even whilst softly purring
its sympathy for Labour on all possible occasions. In all Ireland there
is no journal more ready to proclaim from the housetops its readiness,
and the readiness of the party whose mouthpiece it is, to do something
for the working class, and in all Ireland there is no journal more ready
with the poniard to stab to the heart every person on party that dares
to organise the workers to do anything for themselves.

In this treacherous attitude it is more up-to-date, more thoroughly
modern than its rivals in the Tory press. The latter are clumsy and
antiquated in their methods, as befits the exponents of an antiquated
doctrine, they still clumsily adhere to obsolete methods of attack.

Let me explain. If you wish to point out the attitude of the Orange Tory
press towards the aspirations of Labour, you have just to turn to their
editorials, and there you will find their hostility openly and
undisguisedly expressed to all that Labour holds dear. Having read the
editorials, you know immediately where you are, and how fan to discount
the manner in which the paper chronicles the news of the day.

But if you turn to the editorials in the Home Rule Organ, you get no
such infallible index to the editorial mind.

On the contrary, you find always a sloppy sentiment sloppily expressed
in favour of Labour in the editorials, but all through the news columns,
and in all its headings and sub-headings, you notice that always undue
prominence is given to every item that tells against Labour, the views
of its most unimportant enemies are heralded forth with the utmost
prolixity, and the views of its most eminent partisans are slurred over
and made to read as unintelligibly as possible. If you compare the
telegraphic news printed in the **Irish News** with the telegraphic news
printed in the **Daily News** or **Daily Record**, you will find that
all three Organs, having the same service and the same material to
select from, the **Irish News** has carefully rejected everything that
tells for the organised Labour movement, and has carefully suppressed
every item the mere chronicling of which might convey to its readers an
idea of the justice, power, or growth of the working class in any part
of the world.

It has brought to bear against the Labour movement the most refined and
insidious arts of character assassination.

It never moves against Labour by direct attack. It suppresses here,
exaggerates there, distorts this bit of news, omits this qualifying
sentence from some speech, drops casually a favourable paragraph from
the report of some strike or Labour meeting, and is ever alert to seize
every opportunity to spread the slime of poisonous suggestion over the
most apparently innocuous report of the activities of Labour.

As I have said, it is up-to-date. The more astute of the capitalist
politicians have bong since discovered that the effectual hoodwinking of
the working class must not be done by impassioned or long-winded
editorials, that in fact the working class voters do not devour
editorials as their daily food, but that this hoodwinking and hocussing,
to them so necessary, can best be done by a clever manipulation of the
news items, by an unscrupulous use of their power to suppress truth and
suggest falsehood when apparently only retailing the daily happenings.

You can attack an editor and impale him for false doctrine or slanderous
statement in his editorial, but you cannot attack him when your only
complaint is that his choice of what he shall on shall not report is
different to what you think the circumstances warrant.

And this line of poisonous suggestion is just the line in which the
natural instincts of the editor of the **Irish News** enables him to
excel above his Orange contemporaries. Their line is that of naked,
unashamed reaction stirring up the blackest passions in the lowest
depths of human nature -- the line of the obscurantist and the bigot.
His line is that of the treacherous feline who purrs, and purrs, and
purrs, and scratches with poisonous claws when the purr is most
seductive. The following from the **Irish News** of 18 August is a
choice sample:

> Our Glasgow correspondent writes:--
>
> "The Labour Party announce their intention of trying to increase their
> strength in the Glasgow Town Council at the November elections at the
> expense, they state, of a few reactionaries when they retire. Amongst
> the members of the Labour Party who retire are Councillors P.G.
> Stewart, A.M. Welsh, Lyon, and Bailie Alston. Councillor Lyon just now

> a Labour Party man. Shortly afterwards Mr. Stephen J. Henry, a
> well-known Glasgow Catholic, sought election for the same Ward. The
> now Councillor Lyon opposed him and was returned.
>
> "Certain Labour leaders in Townhead Ward professed anxiety to see Mr.

> Nationalists out of the Council. In November no candidate whose
> politics are of the Tory order will oppose certain Labour candidates.
> When the electors discover the reason there will be a rude awakening
> for some of the Labour Politicians."

The methods of the **Irish News** are the methods of a good many of the
Irish Home Rule papers; as they have to cater for a class of members
whose instincts are all rebellious and revolutionary, and who are
therefore drawn towards the Labour movement, it is necessary that the
anti-Labour bias of the newspaper proprietors and professional
politicians be hidden as carefully as possible, and the anti-Labour
campaign conducted as discreetly as it can.

Moreover, the **Irish News** stands as the journalistic exponent of the
principles of the party of which Joseph Devlin, MP is the representative
in Parliament for West Belfast. And Joe's seat in Parliament is doomed
if he alienates even fifty per cent of the Labour votes. That is to say
that if we take the Labour men who are Labour men before anything else,
before being Nationalists or Unionists, the loss of fifty per cent of
such votes means the boss of West Belfast to the Home Rulers, and giving
over of the Parliamentary representation of Belfast completely to the
Unionists.

The reader will thus see readily how the anti-Labour slime of the editor
of the **Irish News**, despite the care with which it is spread, has yet
aroused such feelings in West Belfast as to make the editor of that
paper the most dangerous ally that the Home Rule party ever had in that
division -- more dangerous to Joe Devlin than a hundred Orange orators.

Other factors are contributing also that make the seat in question more
and more insecure.

Quite recently an attempt was made in Dublin and the South of Ireland to
organise a rival railway union to that of the Amalgamated Society of
Railway Servants. It was intended presumably to break up the forces of
organised Labour on the Irish railways; its inaugural meeting was
attended by a number of well-known Dublin politicians, and heralded with
a great flourish of trumpets in the capitalist press.

The promoters of this scab organisation were the leading officials of
the Ancient Order of Hibernians, of which Mr. Joseph Devlin, MP, is the
president. It failed miserably, nevertheless.

For the past few weeks the tram men in Dublin have been preparing for a
struggle for better conditions. They have the general sympathy of the
Dublin public, as it is well known that they are about the lowest paid
and worst treated of any tram employees in these countries. The company
is, by the way, owned by the editor and proprietor of the
**Independent**, Mr. William Martin Murphy. As soon as these men began
to organise, and the possibility of a struggle began to loom large upon
the horizon, an effort was made to disrupt them by the organisation of
"a tram men's union of which the directors approved".

This disruptive effort was in the care of, and organised by the leading
officials of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, of which Mr. Joseph
Devlin, MP, is president.

Mark, it was only after these poor slaves of the tram line had become
rebellious that an effort was made to get them into a union other than
that which had educated them into a knowledge of their power.

Mr. Joseph Devlin is a very busy man, and he may not know anything of
these attacks upon Labour by his journalistic ally and his A.O.H.
henchmen, but there are a whole lot of voters in West Belfast fully
alive to them all. And their opinion is that *somebody had better call
off their dogs.*

In the North of Ireland, as in Great Britain, the rank and file of the
A.O.H. are generally honest, hardworking Irishmen, Labour in all their
sympathies. I wonder what they will say when they find out, as they will
some day, that their organisation is being prostituted in the interests
of Capital, that it is being made a scab-recruiting agency.

The Ancient Order of Hibernians (Board of Erin) was founded as a weapon
against clerical dictation in politics; it has become a weapon of
political clerics against all Catholics who refuse to take their
politics from the conventional orthodox source.

Mr. Joseph Devlin, MP, used it for Nationalist purposes, it now seeks to
use, if not already using him, for quite other purposes. As soon as Home
Rule is passed into activity, and the inevitable reconstituting of
parties takes place, should 'Wee Joe' elect to follow the democratic
path, I should not be surprised to see the A.O.H. break him and brush
him contemptuously aside, thus proving again that it is one thing to
create a weapon, it is another thing to keep it in your hands, and still
another thing to avoid being bruised by it when the weapon passes into
the hands of others.

In other words, that the economic forces at war in society are stronger
in the long run than the schemes of the most astute wire-pullers.
