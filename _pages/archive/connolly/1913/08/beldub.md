Some four weeks ago I mentioned that Dublin was now the centre of a
storm of industrial discontent and rebellious activity on the part of
the working class, and that this was, as contrasted with the apathy of
Belfast, due to the fact that in Dublin and Nationalist Ireland in
general the Home Rule question had passed out of the regions of
controversy -- was indeed considered a settled question.

A few of my amiable comrades in Belfast chose to consider this as an
attack upon the city instead of taking it as it was meant, as a spur to
greater activity upon correct political lines. Just as when the sweating
for which Belfast is notorious is mentioned, the orthodox Orange press
affects to wax indignant -- not at the sweaters, but at "those who are
besmirching the fair name of Belfast", i.e., those who expose the
sweaters.

The governing factor in winning these battles in Dublin is the fact that
practically all classes of general labour are in one Union, and that the
leader of that Union does not act, nor does his executive with him act,
on old style trade union lines. The general policy is to use the general
body of workers who are organised in order to win concessions for those
who are being organised \...

The firm and skilful use of this power is what is making for the
revolution in wages and conditions in Dublin that is at present going
on. But this would not be possible but for that matchless loyalty to
their class which I have spoken of as a characteristic of the Dublin
workers.

In Belfast, as I have already suggested, there is wanting alike the
necessary forms of organisation, and the class solidarity that make that
organisation possible and effective.

General labour is split up into many ineffective and comparatively
isolated fragments. The dockers and carters are in two distinct,
unrelated organisations. The headquarters of the former is in Dublin, of
the latter in Manchester. Hence the immense power which these two bodies
can use on behalf of their fellows when united action is wanting in
Belfast.

And as fan as class solidarity is concerned, the following quotations
from the capitalist press will speak volumes. They illustrate how the
campaign of religious and political ruffianism initiated by Sir Edward
Carson and his accomplices has broken whatever class solidarity ever
existed in this city, and hence how the first task to our hand here is
the fronting and throttling of this beast of bigotry.

The first extract is from the Dublin **Daily Independent**, a Home Rule
organ, of Tuesday, 12th August:

> "From early yesterday morning until a late hour last night the
> vicinity of the Midland Railway terminus in Belfast was the scene of
> considerable turmoil arising out of an excursion to Portrush of the
> Transport Workers and Textile Workers Organisation. The party, which
> was composed to a large extent of women and children, went in a body
> through York Street, where a Unionist crowd, mostly composed of
> shipyard workers, evidently thinking that the outing had a party
> significance, attacked them with so much violence that a large force
> of police had much difficulty in getting the excursionists on to the
> railway platform.
>
> "From seven o'clock in the evening a rowdy gathering began to collect
> in the vicinity of the railway Station awaiting the return of the
> excursionists. A strong force of police, under the direction of the
> City Commissioner, were present.
>
> "Prior to the arrival of the train there was a scuffle between the
> police and the crowd, who sang *Dolly's Brae* and other Orange
> ballads, to the accompaniment of revolver shots, which could be heard
> in all the adjoining streets and along Royal Avenue. There was also
> some stone-throwing, and a girl was removed to hospital."

The second extract is from the columns of the **Northern Whig**, a rabid
Orange and Unionist organ:--

> "Disorderly scenes attended the departure and return of a dockers
> excursion to Pontrush yesterday. The excursion had been arranged in
> connection with the local Branch of the Irish Transport and General
> Workers' Union -- of which Mr. James Connolly is the Secretary -- who
> were joined in the outing by a number of textile operatives.
>
> "In the morning, when the excursionists, headed by a Labour band,
> marched through York Street to the terminus of the Midland Railway
> (Northern Counties Committee), their progress was followed by a
> hostile crowd of considerable dimensions, and largely composed of mill
> girls, and in the vicinity of the railway station there was some
> stone-throwing, though apparently no one sustained injury.
>
> "The policemen on duty in the vicinity were quickly assembled, but the
> crowd dispersed without further trouble, and the excursionists left by
> the 9:15 a.m. train for the seaside resort.
>
> "In view of the threatening attitude the crowd had adopted in the
> morning the City Commissioner (Mr. T.J. Smith, J.P.), arranged for a
> strong force of police to meet the excursionists on their return to
> the city in the evening about 9 o'clock, and he, with District
> Inspector Robt. Dunlop, attended at the railway station shortly before
> that hour, and directed the movements of the constabulary. A crowd of
> men, women, and mill girls, numbering about 1,000 people, assembled
> outside the station premises to await the transport workers, the
> greaten proportion of those present being hostile.
>
> "The gates of the approaches to the station were closed and locked in
> order that the premises might be kept clean, and so as to obviate as
> far as possible any disorder within the precincts of the station a
> strong cordon of police was engaged in keeping the crowd back from
> these approaches.
>
> "With the arrival of the excursionists at about 9 o'clock the mob in
> the street outside resorted to stone-throwing, and a few revolvers
> were discharged into the air, while feeling evidently ran high.
>
> "The transport workers had originally intended to re-form their
> procession, and march through York Street and other principal
> thoroughfares, as in the morning, but this idea was abandoned before
> the city was reached on the return journey."

A correspondent of **Forward** in a recent edition asked how it was that
if the Orangemen were so bad they allowed Mr. Connolly to hold meetings
in the principal streets of Belfast? Our answer is that neither Mr.
Connolly non any other Socialist can now hold outdoor meetings in an
exclusively Orange district, even those Belfast socialists who "will not
have Home Rule" in their programmes, cannot hold open-air meetings in
any exclusively Orange district. Socialist meetings in Belfast can only
be held in the business centre of the town, where the passing crowd is
of a mixed or uncertain nature.

Another answer to my friend's question is to be found in the incident
related. The excursion was of a purely trade union nature, the Labour
Band accompanying it was its own band -- known as the only non-sectarian
band in Belfast, and has never been known to play any party tunes or
attend any demonstration under the auspices of either of the orthodox
parties in Ireland -- and yet this peaceful excursion was attacked by
stones and revolver shots by an Orange crowd.

The only reason anyone alleged for the attack being that the unions were
Irish organisations with their headquarters in Dublin, and therefore
what is known in Belfast as Fenians. This, and a pleasant desire to kill
your humble servant, is generally recognised as having been the sole
motive inspiring the hostile demonstrations.

All this demonstrates how immensely difficult is the task at present in
Belfast. No part of these countries has a part more difficult. It means
the propagation of twentieth-century revolutionism amidst the mental
atmosphere of the early seventeenth century.

When striving to induce my Belfast comrades to adopt this policy, we are
now propagating in our meetings, I was asked did I think it would make
our propaganda easier. I answered that I did not, that on the contrary
it would arouse passions immensely more bitter than had ever been met
here by the Socialist movement in the past, but it would make our
propaganda more fruitful and our organisation more enduing.

To this I still adhere. A real Socialist movement cannot be built by
temporising in front of a dying cause as that of the Orange ascendancy,
even though in the paroxysms of its death struggle it assumes the
appearance of health. A real Socialist movement can only be born of
struggle, of uncompromising affirmation of the faith that is in US. Such
a movement infallibly gathers to it every element of rebellion and of
progress, and in the midst of the storm and stress of the struggle
solidifies into a real revolutionary force.

Therefore we declare to the Orange workers of Belfast that we stand for
the right of the people in Ireland to rule as well as to own Ireland,
and cannot conceive of a Separation of the two ideas, and to all and
sundry we announce that as Socialists we are Home Rulers, but that on
the day the Home Rule Government goes into power, the Socialist movement
in Ireland will go into Opposition.
