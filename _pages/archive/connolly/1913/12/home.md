Here are some questions that need answering:--

I. Will the Employers' Committee consent to take a ballot of their
members upon the question of the acceptance or rejection of the workers'
offer to accept Sir George Askwith's Report [\[1\]](#n1){#f1} as a basis
for discussion?

II\. Would the present Employers' Executive be re-elected if a ballot of
the members was taken?

III\. How long is it since a vote of the employers was taken in
connection with the present dispute?

IV\. Is it a fact that the present Chairman of the Employers' Executive
desires to prolong the dispute for political reasons, as he is a strong
Unionist, and hopes to injure Home Rule by discrediting the Government?

V. Is it a fact, as commonly stated in Dublin, that a majority of the
employers wish to settle, but are afraid of incurring the enmity of the
financial power of the small clique who they in a foolish moment made
their leaders?

The following letter from one of the children deported [\[2\]](#n2){#f2}
is worth reading, and we, therefore, reproduce it just as it was
written, without making any kind of alteration in the spelling or
punctuation:--

> Drimscott, Beaufort Drive,\
> Wallasey, Cheshire.

> MY DEAR MOTHER, -- Just a few lines to tell you that I received your
> kind and welcome letter. I was glad to find you all well. I want to
> tell you we all go to Mass every Sunday, and Sunday school. We are all
> made say our prayers every morning and night, the lady of the house
> comes round to all the beds and says have all of you said your
> prayers? if we have not said them she makes us say them at once. Mr
> Larkin had a big meeting in Liverpool on Monday night. Connolly spoke
> Larkin also spoke it was a shilling to get in. I was at it selling

> Paddy. God bless you all, good bye.

Larkin's meeting in Liverpool was a great success, in spite of the fact
that a leaflet was issued calling upon the seamen and firemen to prevent
him speaking until he apologised for his criticism of Havelock Wilson
[\[3\]](#n3){#f3} -- a humorous idea. Another leaflet was also issued
calling for a rally of the Orangemen against the meeting. It was hoped,
no doubt, that such tactics would frighten the timid away; but the hall
was crowded, nevertheless.

Speaking of the Seamen's and Firemen's Union, it is worth fixing this
fact -- that there are certain boats belonging to the Head Line of
steamers being worked at present in Dublin by scab labourers from the
Federation ship. [\[4\]](#n4){#f4} As these boats were discharged the
members of the Seamen's and Firemen's Union desired to know their
position in the event of their resolving to stand by ordinary Trade
Union principles and refusing to work a boat that had been discharged by
the lowest form of professional scab labour. Accordingly they wired to
Maritime Hall, London, asking for instructions, and received back a
telegram, signed by Father Hopkins, giving direct instructions to them
to sign on in the scab ships, and thus complete the work the
professional strike-breakers had begun. But, being men, they refused.

### Notes

[1.](#f1){#n1} Askwith headed the Board of Trade inquiry into the
lockout, which proposed that the workers be reinstated, that the
employers' anti-union pledge be withdrawn, and that the union renounce
the sympathetic strike for two years.

[2.](#f2){#n2} That is, sent to the homes of sympathisers in England to
be looked after during the lockout. Catholic activists alleged that the
children's faith was being endangered, and physically prevented all but
a few being sent.

[3.](#f3){#n3} Leader of the National Seamen's and Firemen's Union.

[4.](#f4){#n4} The Shipping Federation was supplying men to break the
strike.
