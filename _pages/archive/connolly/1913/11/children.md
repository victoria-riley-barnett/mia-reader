### (1913)

Our good friend the **Daily Citizen** describes the scenes attendant
upon the intended departure of some Dublin children to Great Britain,
under the auspices of a committee organised there for the purpose of
taking care of children of the locked out workers; as "the most
extraordinary scene in this most extraordinary industrial conflict in
this country."

We do not wonder at our British friends being surprised, nor at them
being horrified, nor at them being scandalised and shocked at the
treatment to which they have been subjected, and the vile aspersions
cast upon their motives. For ourselves we anticipated it all, and have
never been enthusiastic towards the scheme.

We realised that their children are about all the workers of Dublin have
left to comfort them, that amidst the squalor and wretchedness of their
surroundings the love of their little ones shines like a star of
redemption, and that to part with their dear ones would be like
wrenching their hearts asunder. We realised, further, what it is very
difficult to make even the most friendly of the British realise, that
Great Britain is still an alien country to Ireland, and that even the
splendid comradeship and substantial aid of today can hardly expect to
obliterate immediately the evil results upon our intercourse of long
generations of oppression during the period when class rule stood in
Ireland for Great Britain, and symbolised all Britain's relations with
Ireland. And we also knew that some of the darkest memories of Ireland
were associated with British attempts to stab the heart of Ireland
through systematic abduction of the bodies and corruption of the minds
of Irish children.

Therefore we felt instinctively that the well-meant move of Mrs.
Montefiore and her colleagues would arouse in Ireland hostilities and
suspicions they could not conceive of, and would not believe were we to
attempt the task of making the matter clear. Hence, while placing no
obstacle in the way of its fulfilment, and feeling deeply a sense of
gratitude towards the noble British men and women of our class who have
so unreservedly thrown open their homes for the purpose of sheltering
our stricken little ones, we have nevertheless felt that the scheme was
bound to be taken advantage of to our detriment by all the hostile
elements who surround us, but usually fear to reveal their hostility. We
know that people "willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike," swarm
everywhere on the flanks of the labour movement in Ireland, and we also
know that the men and women in charge of that labour movement know how
to keep these people disarmed and ineffective; but that the men and
women in the British labour movement have none of that knowledge of our
enemies nor of our methods for neutralising their hostility.

But when we have said this we have said all that our own position
demands. Having said it, we must protest in the name of the whole labour
movement of this country against the foul and libellous accusations
brought against the noble-minded ladies who have been in charge of the
scheme. One scoundrel in clerical garb is said to have stated on
Wednesday that the children were being "brought to England by trickery,
fraud and corruption for proselytising purposes." Nothing more venomous
and unfounded was ever spewed out of a lying mouth in Ireland since the
seoinin clergy at the bidding of an English politician hounded Parnell
to his grave. Mrs. Montefiore had given his Grace Archbishop Walsh her
assurance that wherever the children went, the local Roman Catholic
clergy would be given their names and addresses, and requested to take
charge of them, and see that they attended to their duties as Catholic
children. His Grace felt that, despite that assurance, and without
doubting it in the least, there would still be dangers. But not for one
moment did he impugn the motives of the ladies in question. His
instincts as a gentleman, and his own high sense of honour forbade. But
what these instincts and that honour forbade his Grace to do was
unblushingly done on Wednesday by a cleric destitute of both. We leave
the gentleman in question to be dealt with by his Grace, who will
assuredly see that in his diocese the garb of a priest is not made a
shield for the acts and language of a scoundrel.

The utterances of his Grace the Archbishop on the question at issue
deserve and no doubt will receive, the earnest consideration of every
thoughtful man and woman in Ireland. Nobody wants to send the children
away -- the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union least of all
desires such a sacrifice. But neither do we wish the children to starve.
We love the children of Ireland, we are sacrificing our own ease and
comfort in order that the future of these children may be sweeter and
happier than the lot of their fathers and mothers. We know that progress
cannot be made without sacrifice, and we do not shrink from the
sacrifice involved in fighting for freedom now in order that future
generations may build upon the results of our toil. But the master class
of Dublin calmly and cold-bloodedly calculate upon using the sufferings
of the children to weaken the resistance of the parents. They wish to
place us upon the horns of a dilemma. Either the parents should resist,
and then the children will starve, or the parents will surrender, and
the children will grow up in slavery, and live to despise the parents
who bequeathed to them such an evil heritage.

Your Grace, we are resolved to fight Death itself -- the death some of
us have already suffered, the death your humble servant has in the same
cause looked in the face without flinching -- it would be preferable to
surrendering the Dublin workers again to the hell of slavery out of
which they are emerging. Your Grace, we will fight!

But if your Grace is as solicitous about the poor bodies of those
children as we know you to be about their souls, or even if you are but
one tenth part as solicitous, may we suggest to you or your laymen that
your duty is plain. See to it that the force of public opinion, that the
power of the press, that all the engines at your command are brought to
bear upon the inhuman monsters who control the means of employment in
Dublin to make them realise their duties to the rest of the community.
We have done our part, we have told the Lord Mayor, we have told Sir
George Askwith, we have told the Dublin Industrial Peace Committee, that
we are ready to negotiate. All of these admit that our position is
reasonable, all of them have been spat upon with scorn by the employers,
and all of them shrink in cowardice from taking the next logical step
and concentrating public feeling and public financial support in favour
of the workers, the only party to the dispute that all along has
declared its readiness to bow to public opinion.

These people, we repeat, have shrunk in cowardice from their manifest
duty. Will you undertake it? It is your duty equally with theirs. To you
we repeat our offer: we are willing to accept the mediation of any party
whose functions will be strictly limited to bringing the two parties
together in a conference to thrash out their differences. We are
prepared to meet the representatives of all the employers, or meet any
individual employer, as we have done satisfactorily in many cases
already. This is our offer to you. And we repeat to you what we have
said to the others:

If the employers reject your offer of mediation and still declare their
contempt for any public opinion they cannot rig in advance, then it is
your manifest duty to organise public support for the workers to defeat
their soulless employers.

We have read your Grace's character in vain if you shrink from that
task, or fail in that duty. The plight of the children, and your concern
for them should be your warrant for acting, if any warrant other than
your high position was needed. Meanwhile, come weal or woe, in good
repute or evil, we are prepared to fight, because we feel that this
fight is a fight for the future, a brighter future for
