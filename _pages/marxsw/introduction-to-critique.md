# Introduction to Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right

## February 1844

For Germany, the criticism of religion has been essentially completed, and the criticism of
religion is the prerequisite of all criticism.

The profane existence of error is compromised as soon as its heavenly oratio pro aris et focis
has been refuted. Man, who has found only the reflection of himself in the fantastic reality of
heaven, where he sought a superman, will no longer feel disposed to find the mere appearance
of himself, the non-man, where he seeks and must seek his true reality.

The foundation of irreligious criticism is: Man makes religion, religion does not make man.
Religion is, indeed, the self-consciousness and self-esteem of man who has either not yet won
through to himself, or has already lost himself again. But man is no abstract being squatting
outside the world. Man is the world of man – state, society. This state and this society produce
religion, which is an inverted consciousness of the world, because they are an inverted world.
Religion is the general theory of this world, its encyclopaedic compendium, its logic in popular
form, its spiritual point d’honneur, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement,
and its universal basis of consolation and justification. It is the fantastic realization of the
human essence since the human essence has not acquired any true reality. The struggle against
religion is, therefore, indirectly the struggle against that world whose spiritual aroma is
religion.

Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest
against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless
world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.

The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real
happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to
give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the
criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo.

Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers on the chain not in order that man shall continue to
bear that chain without fantasy or consolation, but so that he shall throw off the chain and pluck
the living flower. The criticism of religion disillusions man, so that he will think, act, and
fashion his reality like a man who has discarded his illusions and regained his senses, so that he
will move around himself as his own true Sun. Religion is only the illusory Sun which revolves
around man as long as he does not revolve around himself.

It is, therefore, the task of history, once the other-world of truth has vanished, to establish the
truth of this world. It is the immediate task of philosophy, which is in the service of history, to
unmask self-estrangement in its unholy forms once the holy form of human self-estrangement
has been unmasked. Thus, the criticism of Heaven turns into the criticism of Earth, the criticism
of religion into the criticism of law, and the criticism of theology into the criticism of politics.

The following exposition – a contribution to this undertaking – concerns itself not directly with
the original but with a copy, with the German philosophy of the state and of law. The only
reason for this is that it is concerned with Germany.

If we were to begin with the German status quo itself, the result – even if we were to do it in the
only appropriate way, i.e., negatively – would still be an anachronism. Even the negation of our
present political situation is a dusty fact in the historical junk room of modern nations. If I
negate powdered pigtails, I am still left with unpowdered pigtails. If I negate the situation in
Germany in 1843, then according to the French calendar I have barely reached 1789, much less
the vital centre of our present age.


Indeed, German history prides itself on having travelled a road which no other nation in the
whole of history has ever travelled before, or ever will again. We have shared the restorations of
modern nations without ever having shared their revolutions. We have been restored, firstly,
because other nations dared to make revolutions, and, secondly, because other nations suffered
counter-revolutions; on the one hand, because our masters were afraid, and, on the other,
because they were not afraid. With our shepherds to the fore, we only once kept company with
freedom, on the day of its internment.

One school of thought that legitimizes the infamy of today with the infamy of yesterday, a
school that stigmatizes every cry of the serf against the knout as mere rebelliousness once the
knout has aged a little and acquired a hereditary significance and a history, a school to which
history shows nothing but its a posteriori, as did the God of Israel to his servant Moses, the
historical school of law – this school would have invented German history were it not itself an
invention of that history. A Shylock, but a cringing Shylock, that swears by its bond, its
historical bond, its Christian-Germanic bond, for every pound of flesh cut from the heart of the
people.

Good-natured enthusiasts, Germanomaniacs by extraction and free-thinkers by reflexion, on the
contrary, seek our history of freedom beyond our history in the ancient Teutonic forests. But,
what difference is there between the history of our freedom and the history of the boar’s
freedom if it can be found only in the forests? Besides, it is common knowledge that the forest
echoes back what you shout into it. So peace to the ancient Teutonic forests!

War on the German state of affairs! By all means! They are below the level of history, they are
beneath any criticism, but they are still an object of criticism like the criminal who is below the
level of humanity but still an object for the executioner. In the struggle against that state of
affairs, criticism is no passion of the head, it is the head of passion. It is not a lancet, it is a
weapon. Its object is its enemy, which it wants not to refute but to exterminate. For the spirit of
that state of affairs is refuted. In itself, it is no object worthy of thought, it is an existence which
is as despicable as it is despised. Criticism does not need to make things clear to itself as regards
this object, for it has already settled accounts with it. It no longer assumes the quality of an end-
in-itself, but only of a means. Its essential pathos is indignation, its essential work is
denunciation.

It is a case of describing the dull reciprocal pressure of all social spheres one on another, a
general inactive ill-humour, a limitedness which recognizes itself as much as it mistakes itself,
within the frame of government system which, living on the preservation of all wretchedness, is
itself nothing but wretchedness in office.

What a sight! This infinitely proceeding division of society into the most manifold races
opposed to one another by petty antipathies, uneasy consciences, and brutal mediocrity, and
which, precisely because of their reciprocal ambiguous and distrustful attitude, are all, without
exception although with various formalities, treated by their rulers as conceded existences. And
they must recognize and acknowledge as a concession of heaven the very fact that they are
mastered, ruled, possessed! And, on the other side, are the rulers themselves, whose greatness is
in inverse proportion to their number!

Criticism dealing with this content is criticism in a hand-to-hand fight, and in such a fight the
point is not whether the opponent is a noble, equal, interesting opponent, the point is to strike
him. The point is not to let the Germans have a minute for self-deception and resignation. The
actual pressure must be made more pressing by adding to it consciousness of pressure, the
shame must be made more shameful by publicizing it. Every sphere of German society must be
shown as the partie honteuse of German society: these petrified relations must be forced to
dance by singing their own tune to them! The people must be taught to be terrified at itself in
order to give it courage. This will be fulfilling an imperative need of the German nation, and the
needs of the nations are in themselves the ultimate reason for their satisfaction.

This struggle against the limited content of the German status quo cannot be without interest
even for the modern nations, for the German status quo is the open completion of the ancien
régime and the ancien régime is the concealed deficiency of the modern state. The struggle
against the German political present is the struggle against the past of the modern nations, and
they are still burdened with reminders of that past. It is instructive for them to see the ancien


régime, which has been through its tragedy with them, playing its comedy as a German
revenant. Tragic indeed was the pre-existing power of the world, and freedom, on the other
hand, was a personal notion; in short, as long as it believed and had to believe in its own
justification. As long as the ancien régime, as an existing world order, struggled against a world
that was only coming into being, there was on its side a historical error, not a personal one. That
is why its downfall was tragic.

On the other hand, the present German regime, an anachronism, a flagrant contradiction of
generally recognized axioms, the nothingness of the ancien régime exhibited to the world, only
imagines that it believes in itself and demands that the world should imagine the same thing. If
it believed in its own essence, would it try to hide that essence under the semblance of an alien
essence and seek refuge in hypocrisy and sophism? The modern ancien régime is rather only the
comedian of a world order whose true heroes are dead. History is thorough and goes through
many phases when carrying an old form to the grave. The last phases of a world-historical form
is its comedy. The gods of Greece, already tragically wounded to death in Aeschylus’s tragedy
Prometheus Bound, had to re-die a comic death in Lucian’s Dialogues. Why this course of
history? So that humanity should part with its past cheerfully. This cheerful historical destiny is
what we vindicate for the political authorities of Germany.

Meanwhile, once modern politico-social reality itself is subjected to criticism, once criticism
rises to truly human problems, it finds itself outside the German status quo, or else it would
reach out for its object below its object. An example. The relation of industry, of the world of
wealth generally, to the political world is one of the major problems of modern times. In what
form is this problem beginning to engage the attention of the Germans? In the form of protective
duties, of the prohibitive system, of national economy. Germanomania has passed out of man
into matter, and thus one morning our cotton barons and iron heroes saw themselves turned into
patriots. People are, therefore, beginning in Germany to acknowledge the sovereignty of
monopoly on the inside through lending it sovereignty on the outside. People are, therefore, now
about to begin, in Germany, what people in France and England are about to end. The old
corrupt condition against which these countries are revolting in theory, and which they only bear
as one bears chains, is greeted in Germany as the dawn of a beautiful future which still hardly
dares to pass from crafty theory to the most ruthless practice. Whereas the problem in France
and England is: Political economy, or the rule of society over wealth; in Germany, it is: National
economy, or the mastery of private property over nationality. In France and England, then, it is
a case of abolishing monopoly that has proceeded to its last consequences; in Germany, it is a
case of proceeding to the last consequences of monopoly. There it is a case of solution, here as
yet a case of collision. This is an adequate example of the German form of modern problems, an
example of how our history, like a clumsy recruit, still has to do extra drill on things that are old
and hackneyed in history.

If, therefore, the whole German development did not exceed the German political development,
a German could at the most have the share in the problems-of-the-present that a Russian has.
But, when the separate individual is not bound by the limitations of the nation, the nation as a
whole is still less liberated by the liberation of one individual. The fact that Greece had a
Scythian among its philosophers did not help the Scythians to make a single step towards Greek
culture.

Luckily, we Germans are not Scythians.

As the ancient peoples went through their pre-history in imagination, in mythology, so we
Germans have gone through our post-history in thought, in philosophy. We are philosophical
contemporaries of the present without being its historical contemporaries. German philosophy is
the ideal prolongation of German history. If therefore, instead of the oeuvres incompletes of our
real history, we criticize the oeuvres posthumes of our ideal history, philosophy, our criticism is
in the midst of the questions of which the present says: that is the question. What, in progressive
nations, is a practical break with modern state conditions, is, in Germany, where even those
conditions do not yet exist, at first a critical break with the philosophical reflexion of those
conditions.

German philosophy of right and state is the only German history which is al pari with the
official modern present. The German nation must therefore join this, its dream-history, to its
present conditions and subject to criticism not only these existing conditions, but at the same


time their abstract continuation. Its future cannot be limited either to the immediate negation of
its real conditions of state and right, or to the immediate implementation of its ideal state and
right conditions, for it has the immediate negation of its real conditions in its ideal conditions,
and it has almost outlived the immediate implementation of its ideal conditions in the
contemplation of neighboring nations. Hence, it is with good reason that the practical political
party in Germany demands the negation of philosophy.

It is wrong, not in its demand but in stopping at the demand, which it neither seriously
implements nor can implement. It believes that it implements that negation by turning its back
to philosophy and its head away from it and muttering a few trite and angry phrases about it.
Owing to the limitation of its outlook, it does not include philosophy in the circle of German
reality or it even fancies it is beneath German practice and the theories that serve it. You
demand that real life embryos be made the starting-point, but you forget that the real life embryo
of the German nation has grown so far only inside its cranium. In a word – You cannot abolish
[aufheben] philosophy without making it a reality.

The same mistake, but with the factors reversed, was made by the theoretical party originating
from philosophy.

In the present struggle it saw only the critical struggle of philosophy against the German world;
it did not give a thought to the fact that philosophy up to the present itself belongs to this world
and is its completion, although an ideal one. Critical towards its counterpart, it was uncritical
towards itself when, proceeding from the premises of philosophy, it either stopped at the results
given by philosophy or passed off demands and results from somewhere else as immediate
demands and results of philosophy – although these, provided they are justified, can be obtained
only by the negation of philosophy up to the present, of philosophy as such. We reserve
ourselves the right to a more detailed description of this section: It thought it could make
philosophy a reality without abolishing [aufzuheben] it.

The criticism of the German philosophy of state and right, which attained its most consistent,
richest, and last formulation through Hegel, is both a critical analysis of the modern state and of
the reality connected with it, and the resolute negation of the whole manner of the German
consciousness in politics and right as practiced hereto, the most distinguished, most universal
expression of which, raised to the level of science, is the speculative philosophy of right itself. If
the speculative philosophy of right, that abstract extravagant thinking on the modern state, the
reality of which remains a thing of the beyond, if only beyond the Rhine, was possible only in
Germany, inversely the German thought-image of the modern state which makes abstraction of
real man was possible only because and insofar as the modern state itself makes abstraction of
real man, or satisfies the whole of man only in imagination. In politics, the Germans thought
what other nations did. Germany was their theoretical conscience. The abstraction and
presumption of its thought was always in step with the one-sidedness and lowliness of its
reality. If, therefore, the status quo of German statehood expresses the completion of the ancien
régime, the completion of the thorn in the flesh of the modern state, the status quo of German
state science expresses the incompletion of the modern state, the defectiveness of its flesh itself.

Already as the resolute opponent of the previous form of German political consciousness the
criticism of speculative philosophy of right strays, not into itself, but into problems which there
is only one means of solving – practice.

It is asked: can Germany attain a practice à la hauteur des principles – i.e., a revolution which
will raise it not only to the official level of modern nations, but to the height of humanity which
will be the near future of those nations?

The weapon of criticism cannot, of course, replace criticism of the weapon, material force must
be overthrown by material force; but theory also becomes a material force as soon as it has
gripped the masses. Theory is capable of gripping the masses as soon as it demonstrates ad
hominem, and it demonstrates ad hominem as soon as it becomes radical. To be radical is to
grasp the root of the matter. But, for man, the root is man himself. The evident proof of the
radicalism of German theory, and hence of its practical energy, is that is proceeds from a
resolute positive abolition of religion. The criticism of religion ends with the teaching that man
is the highest essence for man – hence, with the categoric imperative to overthrow all relations
in which man is a debased, enslaved, abandoned, despicable essence, relations which cannot be


better described than by the cry of a Frenchman when it was planned to introduce a tax on dogs:
Poor dogs! They want to treat you as human beings!

Even historically, theoretical emancipation has specific practical significance for Germany. For
Germany’s revolutionary past is theoretical, it is the Reformation. As the revolution then began
in the brain of the monk, so now it begins in the brain of the philosopher.

Luther, we grant, overcame bondage out of devotion by replacing it by bondage out of
conviction. He shattered faith in authority because he restored the authority of faith. He turned
priests into laymen because he turned laymen into priests. He freed man from outer religiosity
because he made religiosity the inner man. He freed the body from chains because he enchained
the heart.

But, if Protestantism was not the true solution of the problem, it was at least the true setting of
it. It was no longer a case of the layman’s struggle against the priest outside himself but of his
struggle against his own priest inside himself, his priestly nature. And if the Protestant
transformation of the German layman into priests emancipated the lay popes, the princes, with
the whole of their priestly clique, the privileged and philistines, the philosophical transformation
of priestly Germans into men will emancipate the people. But, secularization will not stop at the
confiscation of church estates set in motion mainly by hypocritical Prussia any more than
emancipation stops at princes. The Peasant War, the most radical fact of German history, came
to grief because of theology. Today, when theology itself has come to grief, the most unfree fact
of German history, our status quo, will be shattered against philosophy. On the eve of the
Reformation, official Germany was the most unconditional slave of Rome. On the eve of its
revolution, it is the unconditional slave of less than Rome, of Prussia and Austria, of country
junkers and philistines.

Meanwhile, a major difficulty seems to stand in the way of a radical German revolution.

For revolutions require a passive element, a material basis. Theory is fulfilled in a people only
insofar as it is the fulfilment of the needs of that people. But will the monstrous discrepancy
between the demands of German thought and the answers of German reality find a
corresponding discrepancy between civil society and the state, and between civil society and
itself? Will the theoretical needs be immediate practical needs? It is not enough for thought to
strive for realization, reality must itself strive towards thought.

But Germany did not rise to the intermediary stage of political emancipation at the same time as
the modern nations. It has not yet reached in practice the stages which it has surpassed in theory.
How can it do a somersault, not only over its own limitations, but at the same time over the
limitations of the modern nations, over limitations which it must in reality feel and strive for as
for emancipation from its real limitations? Only a revolution of radical needs can be a radical
revolution and it seems that precisely the preconditions and ground for such needs are lacking.

If Germany has accompanied the development of the modern nations only with the abstract
activity of thought without taking an effective share in the real struggle of that development, it
has, on the other hand, shared the sufferings of that development, without sharing in its
enjoyment, or its partial satisfaction. To the abstract activity on the one hand corresponds the
abstract suffering on the other. That is why Germany will one day find itself on the level of
European decadence before ever having been on the level of European emancipation. It will be
comparable to a fetish worshipper pining away with the diseases of Christianity.

If we now consider the German governments, we find that because of the circumstances of the
time, because of Germany’s condition, because of the standpoint of German education, and,
finally, under the impulse of its own fortunate instinct, they are driven to combine the civilized
shortcomings of the modern state world, the advantages of which we do not enjoy, with the
barbaric deficiencies of the ancien régime, which we enjoy in full; hence, Germany must share
more and more, if not in the reasonableness, at least in the unreasonableness of those state
formations which are beyond the bounds of its status quo. Is there in the world, for example, a
country which shares so naively in all the illusions of constitutional statehood without sharing in
its realities as so-called constitutional Germany? And was it not perforce the notion of a German
government to combine the tortures of censorship with the tortures of the French September
[anti-press] laws which provide for freedom of the press? As you could find the gods of all
nations in the Roman Pantheon, so you will find in the Germans’ Holy Roman Empire all the


sins of all state forms. That this eclecticism will reach a so far unprecedented height is
guaranteed in particular by the political-aesthetic gourmanderie of a German king who intended
to play all the roles of monarchy, whether feudal or democratic, if not in the person of the
people, at least in his own person, and if not for the people, at least for himself. Germany, as the
deficiency of the political present constituted a world of its own, will not be able to throw down
the specific German limitations without throwing down the general limitation of the political
present.

It is not the radical revolution, not the general human emancipation which is a utopian dream
for Germany, but rather the partial, the merely political revolution, the revolution which leaves
the pillars of the house standing. On what is a partial, a merely political revolution based? On
part of civil society emancipating itself and attaining general domination; on a definite class,
proceeding from its particular situation; undertaking the general emancipation of society. This
class emancipates the whole of society, but only provided the whole of society is in the same
situation as this class – e.g., possesses money and education or can acquire them at will.

No class of civil society can play this role without arousing a moment of enthusiasm in itself
and in the masses, a moment in which it fraternizes and merges with society in general, becomes
confused with it and is perceived and acknowledged as its general representative, a moment in
which its claims and rights are truly the claims and rights of society itself, a moment in which it
is truly the social head and the social heart. Only in the name of the general rights of society can
a particular class vindicate for itself general domination. For the storming of this emancipatory
position, and hence for the political exploitation of all sections of society in the interests of its
own section, revolutionary energy and spiritual self-feeling alone are not sufficient. For the
revolution of a nation, and the emancipation of a particular class of civil society to coincide, for
one estate to be acknowledged as the estate of the whole society, all the defects of society must
conversely be concentrated in another class, a particular estate must be the estate of the general
stumbling-block, the incorporation of the general limitation, a particular social sphere must be
recognized as the notorious crime of the whole of society, so that liberation from that sphere
appears as general self-liberation. For one estate to be par excellence the estate of liberation,
another estate must conversely be the obvious estate of oppression. The negative general
significance of the French nobility and the French clergy determined the positive general
significance of the nearest neighboring and opposed class of the bourgeoisie.

But no particular class in Germany has the constituency, the penetration, the courage, or the
ruthlessness that could mark it out as the negative representative of society. No more has any
estate the breadth of soul that identifies itself, even for a moment, with the soul of the nation, the
geniality that inspires material might to political violence, or that revolutionary daring which
flings at the adversary the defiant words: I am nothing but I must be everything. The main stem
of German morals and honesty, of the classes as well as of individuals, is rather that modest
egoism which asserts its limitedness and allows it to be asserted against itself. The relation of
the various sections of German society is therefore not dramatic but epic. Each of them begins
to be aware of itself and begins to camp beside the others with all its particular claims not as
soon as it is oppressed, but as soon as the circumstances of the time, without the section’s own
participation, creates a social substratum on which it can in turn exert pressure. Even the moral
self-feeling of the German middle class rests only on the consciousness that it is the common
representative of the philistine mediocrity of all the other classes. It is therefore not only the
German kings who accede to the throne mal à propos, it is every section of civil society which
goes through a defeat before it celebrates victory and develops its own limitations before it
overcomes the limitations facing it, asserts its narrow-hearted essence before it has been able to
assert its magnanimous essence; thus the very opportunity of a great role has passed away
before it is to hand, and every class, once it begins the struggle against the class opposed to it, is
involved in the struggle against the class below it. Hence, the higher nobility is struggling
against the monarchy, the bureaucrat against the nobility, and the bourgeois against them all,
while the proletariat is already beginning to find itself struggling against the bourgeoisie. The
middle class hardly dares to grasp the thought of emancipation from its own standpoint when
the development of the social conditions and the progress of political theory already declare that
standpoint antiquated or at least problematic.


In France, it is enough for somebody to be something for him to want to be everything; in
Germany, nobody can be anything if he is not prepared to renounce everything. In France,
partial emancipation is the basis of universal emancipation; in Germany, universal emancipation
is the conditio sine qua non of any partial emancipation. In France, it is the reality of gradual
liberation that must give birth to complete freedom, in Germany, the impossibility of gradual
liberation. In France, every class of the nation is a political idealist and becomes aware of itself
at first not as a particular class but as a representative of social requirements generally. The role
of emancipator therefore passes in dramatic motion to the various classes of the French nation
one after the other until it finally comes to the class which implements social freedom no longer
with the provision of certain conditions lying outside man and yet created by human society, but
rather organizes all conditions of human existence on the premises of social freedom. On the
contrary, in Germany, where practical life is as spiritless as spiritual life is unpractical, no class
in civil society has any need or capacity for general emancipation until it is forced by its
immediate condition, by material necessity, by its very chains.

Where, then, is the positive possibility of a German emancipation?

Answer: In the formulation of a class with radical chains, a class of civil society which is not a
class of civil society, an estate which is the dissolution of all estates, a sphere which has a
universal character by its universal suffering and claims no particular right because no
particular wrong, but wrong generally, is perpetuated against it; which can invoke no historical,
but only human, title; which does not stand in any one-sided antithesis to the consequences but
in all-round antithesis to the premises of German statehood; a sphere, finally, which cannot
emancipate itself without emancipating itself from all other spheres of society and thereby
emancipating all other spheres of society, which, in a word, is the complete loss of man and
hence can win itself only through the complete re-winning of man. This dissolution of society as
a particular estate is the proletariat.

The proletariat is beginning to appear in Germany as a result of the rising industrial movement.
For, it is not the naturally arising poor but the artificially impoverished, not the human masses
mechanically oppressed by the gravity of society, but the masses resulting from the drastic
dissolution of society, mainly of the middle estate, that form the proletariat, although, as is
easily understood, the naturally arising poor and the Christian-Germanic serfs gradually join its
ranks.

By heralding the dissolution of the hereto existing world order, the proletariat merely proclaims
the secret of its own existence, for it is the factual dissolution of that world order. By demanding
the negation of private property, the proletariat merely raises to the rank of a principle of society
what society has raised to the rank of its principle, what is already incorporated in it as the
negative result of society without its own participation. The proletarian then finds himself
possessing the same right in regard to the world which is coming into being as the German king
in regard to the world which has come into being when he calls the people his people, as he calls
the horse his horse. By declaring the people his private property, the king merely proclaims that
the private owner is king.

As philosophy finds its material weapon in the proletariat, so the proletariat finds its spiritual
weapon in philosophy. And once the lightning of thought has squarely struck this ingenuous soil
of the people, the emancipation of the Germans into men will be accomplished.

Let us sum up the result:

The only liberation of Germany which is practically possible is liberation from the point of view
of that theory which declares man to be the supreme being for man. Germany can emancipate
itself from the Middle Ages only if it emancipates itself at the same time from the partial
victories over the Middle Ages. In Germany, no form of bondage can be broken without
breaking all forms of bondage. Germany, which is renowned for its thoroughness, cannot make
a revolution unless it is a thorough one. The emancipation of the German is the emancipation of
man. The head of this emancipation is philosophy, its heart the proletariat. Philosophy cannot
realize itself without the transcendence [Aufhebung] of the proletariat, and the proletariat cannot
transcend itself without the realization of philosophy.

When all the inner conditions are met, the day of the German resurrection will be heralded by
the crowing of the cock of Gaul.
