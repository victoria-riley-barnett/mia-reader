## The Paris Commune

## The Paris Commune Address to the International Workingmen’s Association, May

## Association, 

On the dawn of March 18, Paris arose to the thunder-burst of “Vive la Commune!” What is the
Commune, that sphinx so tantalizing to the bourgeois mind?

“The proletarians of Paris,” said the Central Committee in its manifesto of March 18, “amidst
the failures and treasons of the ruling classes, have understood that the hour has struck for them
to save the situation by taking into their own hands the direction of public affairs.... They have
understood that it is their imperious duty, and their absolute right, to render themselves masters
of their own destinies, by seizing upon the governmental power.”

But the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery, and
wield it for its own purposes.

The centralized state power, with its ubiquitous organs of standing army, police, bureaucracy,
clergy, and judicature – organs wrought after the plan of a systematic and hierarchic division of
labor – originates from the days of absolute monarchy, serving nascent bourgeois society as a
mighty weapon in its struggle against feudalism. Still, its development remained clogged by all
manner of medieval rubbish, seignorial rights, local privileges, municipal and guild monopolies,
and provincial constitutions. The gigantic broom of the French Revolution of the 18th century
swept away all these relics of bygone times, thus clearing simultaneously the social soil of its
last hindrances to the superstructure of the modern state edifice raised under the First Empire,
itself the offspring of the coalition wars of old semi-feudal Europe against modern France.

During the subsequent regimes, the government, placed under parliamentary control – that is,
under the direct control of the propertied classes – became not only a hotbed of huge national
debts and crushing taxes; with its irresistible allurements of place, pelf, and patronage, it became
not only the bone of contention between the rival factions and adventurers of the ruling classes;
but its political character changed simultaneously with the economic changes of society. At the
same pace at which the progress of modern industry developed, widened, intensified the class
antagonism between capital and labor, the state power assumed more and more the character of
the national power of capital over labor, of a public force organized for social enslavement, of
an engine of class despotism.

After every revolution marking a progressive phase in the class struggle, the purely repressive
character of the state power stands out in bolder and bolder relief. The Revolution of 1830,
resulting in the transfer of government from the landlords to the capitalists, transferred it from
the more remote to the more direct antagonists of the working men. The bourgeois republicans,
who, in the name of the February Revolution, took the state power, used it for the June [1848]
massacres, in order to convince the working class that “social” republic means the republic
entrusting their social subjection, and in order to convince the royalist bulk of the bourgeois and
landlord class that they might safely leave the cares and emoluments of government to the
bourgeois “republicans.”

However, after their one heroic exploit of June, the bourgeois republicans had, from the front, to
fall back to the rear of the “Party of Order” – a combination formed by all the rival fractions and
factions of the appropriating classes. The proper form of their joint-stock government was the
parliamentary republic, with Louis Bonaparte for its president. Theirs was a regime of avowed
class terrorism and deliberate insult towards the “vile multitude.”

If the parliamentary republic, as M. Thiers said, “divided them [the different fractions of the
ruling class] least,” it opened an abyss between that class and the whole body of society outside
their spare ranks. The restraints by which their own divisions had under former regimes still
checked the state power, were removed by their union; and in view of the threatening upheaval


of the proletariat, they now used that state power mercilessly and ostentatiously as the national
war engine of capital against labor.

In their uninterrupted crusade against the producing masses, they were, however, bound not
only to invest the executive with continually increased powers of repression, but at the same
time to divest their own parliamentary stronghold – the National Assembly – one by one, of all
its own means of defence against the Executive. The Executive, in the person of Louis
Bonaparte, turned them out. The natural offspring of the “Party of Order” republic was the
Second Empire.

The empire, with the coup d’état for its birth certificate, universal suffrage for its sanction, and
the sword for its sceptre, professed to rest upon the peasantry, the large mass of producers not
directly involved in the struggle of capital and labor. It professed to save the working class by
breaking down parliamentarism, and, with it, the undisguised subserviency of government to the
propertied classes. It professed to save the propertied classes by upholding their economic
supremacy over the working class; and, finally, it professed to unite all classes by reviving for
all the chimera of national glory.

In reality, it was the only form of government possible at a time when the bourgeoisie had
already lost, and the working class had not yet acquired, the faculty of ruling the nation. It was
acclaimed throughout the world as the savior of society. Under its sway, bourgeois society,
freed from political cares, attained a development unexpected even by itself. Its industry and
commerce expanded to colossal dimensions; financial swindling celebrated cosmopolitan
orgies; the misery of the masses was set off by a shameless display of gorgeous, meretricious
and debased luxury. The state power, apparently soaring high above society and the very hotbed
of all its corruptions. Its own rottenness, and the rottenness of the society it had saved, were laid
bare by the bayonet of Prussia, herself eagerly bent upon transferring the supreme seat of that
regime from Paris to Berlin. Imperialism is, at the same time, the most prostitute and the
ultimate form of the state power which nascent bourgeois society had commenced to elaborate
as a means of its own emancipation from feudalism, and which full-grown bourgeois society
had finally transformed into a means for the enslavement of labor by capital.

The direct antithesis to the empire was the Commune. The cry of “social republic,” with which
the February [1848] Revolution was ushered in by the Paris proletariat, did but express a vague
aspiration after a republic that was not only to supercede the monarchical form of class rule, but
class rule itself. The Commune was the positive form of that republic.

Paris, the central seat of the old governmental power, and, at the same time, the social
stronghold of the French working class, had risen in arms against the attempt of Thiers and the
Rurals to restore and perpetuate that old governmental power bequeathed to them by the empire.
Paris could resist only because, in consequence of the siege, it had got rid of the army, and
replaced it by a National Guard, the bulk of which consisted of working men. This fact was now
to be transformed into an institution. The first decree of the Commune, therefore, was the
suppression of the standing army, and the substitution for it of the armed people.

The Commune was formed of the municipal councillors, chosen by universal suffrage in the
various wards of the town, responsible and revocable at short terms. The majority of its
members were naturally working men, or acknowledged representatives of the working class.
The Commune was to be a working, not a parliamentary body, executive and legislative at the
same time.

Instead of continuing to be the agent of the Central Government, the police was at once stripped
of its political attributes, and turned into the responsible, and at all times revocable, agent of the
Commune. So were the officials of all other branches of the administration. From the members
of the Commune downwards, the public service had to be done at workman’s wage. The vested
interests and the representation allowances of the high dignitaries of state disappeared along
with the high dignitaries themselves. Public functions ceased to be the private property of the
tools of the Central Government. Not only municipal administration, but the whole initiative
hitherto exercised by the state was laid into the hands of the Commune.

Having once got rid of the standing army and the police – the physical force elements of the old
government – the Commune was anxious to break the spiritual force of repression, the “parson-
power,” by the disestablishment and disendowment of all churches as proprietary bodies. The


priests were sent back to the recesses of private life, there to feed upon the alms of the faithful in
imitation of their predecessors, the apostles.

The whole of the educational institutions were opened to the people gratuitously, and at the
same time cleared of all interference of church and state. Thus, not only was education made
accessible to all, but science itself freed from the fetters which class prejudice and governmental
force had imposed upon it.

The judicial functionaries were to be divested of that sham independence which had but served
to mask their abject subserviency to all succeeding governments to which, in turn, they had
taken, and broken, the oaths of allegiance. Like the rest of public servants, magistrates and
judges were to be elective, responsible, and revocable.

The Paris Commune was, of course, to serve as a model to all the great industrial centres of
France. The communal regime once established in Paris and the secondary centres, the old
centralized government would in the provinces, too, have to give way to the self-government of
the producers.

In a rough sketch of national organization, which the Commune had no time to develop, it states
clearly that the Commune was to be the political form of even the smallest country hamlet, and
that in the rural districts the standing army was to be replaced by a national militia, with an
extremely short term of service. The rural communities of every district were to administer their
common affairs by an assembly of delegates in the central town, and these district assemblies
were again to send deputies to the National Delegation in Paris, each delegate to be at any time
revocable and bound by the mandat imperatif (formal instructions) of his constituents. The few
but important functions which would still remain for a central government were not to be
suppressed, as has been intentionally misstated, but were to be discharged by Communal and
thereafter responsible agents.

The unity of the nation was not to be broken, but, on the contrary, to be organized by Communal
Constitution, and to become a reality by the destruction of the state power which claimed to be
the embodiment of that unity independent of, and superior to, the nation itself, from which it
was but a parasitic excrescence.

While the merely repressive organs of the old governmental power were to be amputated, its
legitimate functions were to be wrested from an authority usurping pre-eminence over society
itself, and restored to the responsible agents of society. Instead of deciding once in three or six
years which member of the ruling class was to misrepresent the people in Parliament, universal
suffrage was to serve the people, constituted in Communes, as individual suffrage serves every
other employer in the search for the workmen and managers in his business. And it is well-
known that companies, like individuals, in matters of real business generally know how to put
the right man in the right place, and, if they for once make a mistake, to redress it promptly. On
the other hand, nothing could be more foreign to the spirit of the Commune than to supercede
universal suffrage by hierarchical investiture.

It is generally the fate of completely new historical creations to be mistaken for the counterparts
of older, and even defunct, forms of social life, to which they may bear a certain likeness. Thus,
this new Commune, which breaks with the modern state power, has been mistaken for a
reproduction of the medieval Communes, which first preceded, and afterward became the
substratum of, that very state power. The Communal Constitution has been mistaken for an
attempt to break up into the federation of small states, as dreamt of by Montesquieu and the
Girondins, that unity of great nations which, if originally brought about by political force, has
now become a powerful coefficient of social production. The antagonism of the Commune
against the state power has been mistaken for an exaggerated form of the ancient struggle
against over-centralization. Peculiar historical circumstances may have prevented the classical
development, as in France, of the bourgeois form of government, and may have allowed, as in
England, to complete the great central state organs by corrupt vestries, jobbing councillors, and
ferocious poor-law guardians in the towns, and virtually hereditary magistrates in the counties.

The Communal Constitution would have restored to the social body all the forces hitherto
absorbed by the state parasite feeding upon, and clogging the free movement of, society. By this
one act, it would have initiated the regeneration of France.


The provincial French bourgeois saw in the Commune an attempt to restore the sway their order
had held over the country under Louis Philippe, and which, under Louis Napoleon, was
supplanted by the pretended rule of the country over the towns. In reality, the Communal
Constitution brought the rural producers under the intellectual lead of the central towns of their
districts, and there secured to them, in the working men, the natural trustees of their interests.
The very existence of the Commune involved, as a matter of course, local municipal liberty, but
no longer as a check upon the now superseded state power. It could only enter into the head of a
Bismarck – who, when not engaged on his intrigues of blood and iron, always likes to resume
his old trade, so befitting his mental calibre, of contributor to Kladderadatsch (the Berlin
Punch) – it could only enter into such a head to ascribe to the Paris Commune aspirations after
the caricature of the old French municipal organization of 1791, the Prussian municipal
constitution which degrades the town governments to mere secondary wheels in the police
machinery of the Prussian state. The Commune made that catchword of bourgeois revolutions –
cheap government – a reality by destroying the two greatest sources of expenditure: the standing
army and state functionarism. Its very existence presupposed the non-existence of monarchy,
which, in Europe at least, is the normal encumbrance and indispensable cloak of class rule. It
supplied the republic with the basis of really democratic institutions. But neither cheap
government nor the “true republic” was its ultimate aim; they were its mere concomitants.

The multiplicity of interpretations to which the Commune has been subjected, and the
multiplicity of interests which construed it in their favor, show that it was a thoroughly
expansive political form, while all the previous forms of government had been emphatically
repressive. Its true secret was this: It was essentially a working class government, the product of
the struggle of the producing against the appropriating class, the political form at last discovered
under which to work out the economical emancipation of labor.

Except on this last condition, the Communal Constitution would have been an impossibility and
a delusion. The political rule of the producer cannot co-exist with the perpetuation of his social
slavery. The Commune was therefore to serve as a lever for uprooting the economical
foundation upon which rests the existence of classes, and therefore of class rule. With labor
emancipated, every man becomes a working man, and productive labor ceases to be a class
attribute.

It is a strange fact. In spite of all the tall talk and all the immense literature, for the last 60 years,
about emancipation of labor, no sooner do the working men anywhere take the subject into their
own hands with a will, than uprises at once all the apologetic phraseology of the mouthpieces of
present society with its two poles of capital and wage-slavery (the landlord now is but the
sleeping partner of the capitalist), as if the capitalist society was still in its purest state of virgin
innocence, with its antagonisms still undeveloped, with its delusions still unexploded, with its
prostitute realities not yet laid bare. The Commune, they exclaim, intends to abolish property,
the basis of all civilization!

Yes, gentlemen, the Commune intended to abolish that class property which makes the labor of
the many the wealth of the few. It aimed at the expropriation of the expropriators. It wanted to
make individual property a truth by transforming the means of production, land, and capital,
now chiefly the means of enslaving and exploiting labor, into mere instruments of free and
associated labor. But this is communism, “impossible” communism! Why, those member of the
ruling classes who are intelligent enough to perceive the impossibility of continuing the present
system – and they are many – have become the obtrusive and full-mouthed apostles of co-
operative production. If co-operative production is not to remain a sham and a snare; if it is to
supersede the capitalist system; if united co-operative societies are to regulate national
production upon common plan, thus taking it under their own control, and putting an end to the
constant anarchy and periodical convulsions which are the fatality of capitalist production –
what else, gentlemen, would it be but communism, “possible” communism?

The working class did not expect miracles from the Commune. They have no ready-made
utopias to introduce par decret du peuple. They know that in order to work out their own
emancipation, and along with it that higher form to which present society is irresistibly tending
by its own economical agencies, they will have to pass through long struggles, through a series
of historic processes, transforming circumstances and men. They have no ideals to realize, but to
set free the elements of the new society with which old collapsing bourgeois society itself is


pregnant. In the full consciousness of their historic mission, and with the heroic resolve to act up
to it, the working class can afford to smile at the coarse invective of the gentlemen’s gentlemen
with pen and inkhorn, and at the didactic patronage of well-wishing bourgeois-doctrinaires,
pouring forth their ignorant platitudes and sectarian crotchets in the oracular tone of scientific
infallibility.

When the Paris Commune took the management of the revolution in its own hands; when plain
working men for the first time dared to infringe upon the governmental privilege of their
“natural superiors,” and, under circumstances of unexampled difficulty, performed it at salaries
the highest of which barely amounted to one-fifth what, according to high scientific authority, is
the minimum required for a secretary to a certain metropolitan school-board – the old world
writhed in convulsions of rage at the sight of the Red Flag, the symbol of the Republic of Labor,
floating over the Hotel de Ville.

And yet, this was the first revolution in which the working class was openly acknowledged as
the only class capable of social initiative, even by the great bulk of the Paris bourgeois –
shopkeepers, tradesmen, merchants – the wealthy capitalist alone excepted. The Commune had
saved them by a sagacious settlement of that ever recurring cause of dispute among the
bourgeois themselves – the debtor and creditor accounts. The same portion of the bourgeois,
after they had assisted in putting down the working men’s insurrection of June 1848, had been at
once unceremoniously sacrificed to their creditors by the then Constituent Assembly. But this
was not their only motive for now rallying around the working class. They felt there was but one
alternative – the Commune, or the empire – under whatever name it might reappear. The empire
had ruined them economically by the havoc it made of public wealth, by the wholesale financial
swindling it fostered, by the props it lent to the artificially accelerated centralization of capital,
and the concomitant expropriation of their own ranks. It had suppressed them politically, it had
shocked them morally by its orgies, it had insulted their Voltairianism by handing over the
education of their children to the fréres Ignorantins, it had revolted their national feeling as
Frenchmen by precipitating them headlong into a war which left only one equivalent for the
ruins it made – the disappearance of the empire. In fact, after the exodus from Paris of the high
Bonapartist and capitalist bohème, the true bourgeois Party of Order came out in the shape of
the “Union Republicaine,” enrolling themselves under the colors of the Commune and
defending it against the wilful misconstructions of Thiers. Whether the gratitude of this great
body of the bourgeois will stand the present severe trial, time must show.

The Commune was perfectly right in telling the peasants that “its victory was their only hope.”
Of all the lies hatched at Versailles and re-echoed by the glorious European penny-a-liner, one
of the most tremendous was that the Rurals represented the French peasantry. Think only of the
love of the French peasant for the men to whom, after 1815, he had to pay the milliard
indemnity. In the eyes of the French peasant, the very existence of a great landed proprietor is in
itself an encroachment on his conquests of 1789. The bourgeois, in 1848, had burdened his plot
of land with the additional tax of 45 cents, in the franc; but then he did so in the name of the
revolution; while now he had fomented a civil war against revolution, to shift on to the peasant’s
shoulders the chief load of the 5 milliards of indemnity to be paid to the Prussian. The
Commune, on the other hand, in one of its first proclamations, declared that the true originators
of the war would be made to pay its cost. The Commune would have delivered the peasant of
the blood tax – would have given him a cheap government – transformed his present blood-
suckers, the notary, advocate, executor, and other judicial vampires, into salaried communal
agents, elected by, and responsible to, himself. It would have freed him of the tyranny of the
garde champêtre, the gendarme, and the prefect; would have put enlightenment by the
schoolmaster in the place of stultification by the priest. And the French peasant is, above all, a
man of reckoning. He would find it extremely reasonable that the pay of the priest, instead of
being extorted by the tax-gatherer, should only depend upon the spontaneous action of the
parishioners’ religious instinct. Such were the great immediate boons which the rule of the
Commune – and that rule alone – held out to the French peasantry. It is, therefore, quite
superfluous here to expatiate upon the more complicated but vital problems which the
Commune alone was able, and at the same time compelled, to solve in favor of the peasant –
viz., the hypothecary debt, lying like an incubus upon his parcel of soil, the prolétariat foncier
(the rural proletariat), daily growing upon it, and his expropriation from it enforced, at a more


and more rapid rate, by the very development of modern agriculture and the competition of
capitalist farming.

The French peasant had elected Louis Bonaparte president of the republic; but the Party of
Order created the empire. What the French peasant really wants he commenced to show in 1849
and 1850, by opposing his maire to the government’s prefect, his school-master to the
government’s priest, and himself to the government’s gendarme. All the laws made by the Party
of Order in January and February 1850 were avowed measures of repression against the peasant.
The peasant was a Bonapartist, because the Great Revolution, with all its benefits to him, was,
in his eyes, personified in Napoleon. This delusion, rapidly breaking down under the Second
Empire (and in its very nature hostile to the Rurals), this prejudice of the past, how could it have
withstood the appeal of the Commune to the living interests and urgent wants of the peasantry?

The Rurals – this was, in fact, their chief apprehension – knew that three months’ free
communication of Communal Paris with the provinces would bring about a general rising of the
peasants, and hence their anxiety to establish a police blockade around Paris, so as to stop the
spread of the rinderpest [cattle pest – contagious disease].

If the Commune was thus the true representative of all the healthy elements of French society,
and therefore the truly national government, it was, at the same time, as a working men’s
government, as the bold champion of the emancipation of labor, emphatically international.
Within sight of that Prussian army, that had annexed to Germany two French provinces, the
Commune annexed to France the working people all over the world.

The Second Empire had been the jubilee of cosmopolitan blackleggism, the rakes of all
countries rushing in at its call for a share in its orgies and in the plunder of the French people.
Even at this moment, the right hand of Thiers is Ganessco, the foul Wallachian, and his left
hand is Markovsky, the Russian spy. The Commune admitted all foreigners to the honor of
dying for an immortal cause. Between the foreign war lost by their treason, and the civil war
fomented by their conspiracy with the foreign invader, the bourgeoisie had found the time to
display their patriotism by organizing police hunts upon the Germans in France. The Commune
made a German working man [Leo Frankel] its Minister of Labor. Thiers, the bourgeoisie, the
Second Empire, had continually deluded Poland by loud professions of sympathy, while in
reality betraying her to, and doing the dirty work of, Russia. The Commune honoured the heroic
sons of Poland [J. Dabrowski and W. Wróblewski] by placing them at the head of the defenders
of Paris. And, to broadly mark the new era of history it was conscious of initiating, under the
eyes of the conquering Prussians on one side, and the Bonapartist army, led by Bonapartist
generals, on the other, the Commune pulled down that colossal symbol of martial glory, the
Vendôme Column.

The great social measure of the Commune was its own working existence. Its special measures
could but betoken the tendency of a government of the people by the people. Such were the
abolition of the nightwork of journeymen bakers; the prohibition, under penalty, of the
employers’ practice to reduce wages by levying upon their workpeople fines under manifold
pretexts – a process in which the employer combines in his own person the parts of legislator,
judge, and executor, and filches the money to boot. Another measure of this class was the
surrender to associations of workmen, under reserve of compensation, of all closed workshops
and factories, no matter whether the respective capitalists had absconded or preferred to strike
work.

The financial measures of the Commune, remarkable for their sagacity and moderation, could
only be such as were compatible with the state of a besieged town. Considering the colossal
robberies committed upon the city of Paris by the great financial companies and contractors,
under the protection of Haussman, the Commune would have had an incomparably better title to
confiscate their property than Louis Napoleon had against the Orleans family. The Hohenzollern
and the English oligarchs, who both have derived a good deal of their estates from church
plunders, were, of course, greatly shocked at the Commune clearing but 8,000f out of
secularization.

While the Versailles government, as soon as it had recovered some spirit and strength, used the
most violent means against the Commune; while it put down the free expression of opinion all
over France, even to the forbidding of meetings of delegates from the large towns; while it


subjected Versailles and the rest of France to an espionage far surpassing that of the Second
Empire; while it burned by its gendarme inquisitors all papers printed at Paris, and sifted all
correspondence from and to Paris; while in the National Assembly the most timid attempts to
put in a word for Paris were howled down in a manner unknown even to the Chambre
introuvable of 1816; with the savage warfare of Versailles outside, and its attempts at corruption
and conspiracy inside Paris – would the Commune not have shamefully betrayed its trust by
affecting to keep all the decencies and appearances of liberalism as in a time of profound peace?
Had the government of the Commune been akin to that of M. Thiers, there would have been no
more occasion to suppress Party of Order papers at Paris that there was to suppress Communal
papers at Versailles.

It was irritating indeed to the Rurals that at the very same time they declared the return to the
church to be the only means of salvation for France, the infidel Commune unearthed the
peculiar mysteries of the Picpus nunnery, and of the Church of St. Laurent. It was a satire upon
M. Thiers that, while he showered grand crosses upon the Bonapartist generals in
acknowledgment of their mastery in losing battles, singing capitulations, and turning cigarettes
at Wilhelmshöhe, the Commune dismissed and arrested its generals whenever they were
suspected of neglecting their duties. The expulsion from, and arrest by, the Commune of one of
its members [Blanchet] who had slipped in under a false name, and had undergone at Lyons six
days’ imprisonment for simple bankruptcy, was it not a deliberate insult hurled at the forger,
Jules Favre, then still the foreign minister of France, still selling France to Bismarck, and still
dictating his orders to that paragon government of Belgium? But indeed the Commune did not
pretend to infallibility, the invariable attribute of all governments of the old stamp. It published
its doings and sayings, it initiated the public into all its shortcomings.

In every revolution there intrude, at the side of its true agents, men of different stamp; some of
them survivors of and devotees to past revolutions, without insight into the present movement,
but preserving popular influence by their known honesty and courage, or by the sheer force of
tradition; others mere brawlers who, by dint of repeating year after year the same set of
stereotyped declarations against the government of the day, have sneaked into the reputation of
revolutionists of the first water. After March 18, some such men did also turn up, and in some
cases contrived to play pre-eminent parts. As far as their power went, they hampered the real
action of the working class, exactly as men of that sort have hampered the full development of
every previous revolution. They are an unavoidable evil: with time they are shaken off; but time
was not allowed to the Commune.

Wonderful, indeed, was the change the Commune had wrought in Paris! No longer any trace of
the tawdry Paris of the Second Empire! No longer was Paris the rendezvous of British landlords,
Irish absentees, American ex-slaveholders and shoddy men, Russian ex-serfowners, and
Wallachian boyards. No more corpses at the morgue, no nocturnal burglaries, scarcely any
robberies; in fact, for the first time since the days of February 1848, the streets of Paris were
safe, and that without any police of any kind.

“We,” said a member of the Commune, “hear no longer of assassination, theft, and personal
assault; it seems indeed as if the police had dragged along with it to Versailles all its
Conservative friends.”

The cocottes had refound the scent of their protectors – the absconding men of family, religion,
and, above all, of property. In their stead, the real women of Paris showed again at the surface –
heroic, noble, and devoted, like the women of antiquity. Working, thinking fighting, bleeding
Paris – almost forgetful, in its incubation of a new society, of the Cannibals at its gates – radiant
in the enthusiasm of its historic initiative!

Opposed to this new world at Paris, behold the old world at Versailles – that assembly of the
ghouls of all defunct regimes, Legitimists and Orleanists, eager to feed upon the carcass of the
nation – with a tail of antediluvian republicans, sanctioning, by their presence in the Assembly,
the slaveholders’ rebellion, relying for the maintenance of their parliamentary republic upon the
vanity of the senile mountebank at its head, and caricaturing 1789 by holding their ghastly
meetings in the Jeu de Paume. There it was, this Assembly, the representative of everything
dead in France, propped up to the semblance of life by nothing but the swords of the generals of
Louis Bonaparte. Paris all truth, Versailles all lie; and that lie vented through the mouth of
Thiers.


Thiers tells a deputation of the mayors of the Seine-et-Oise – “You may rely upon my word,
which I have never broken!”

He tells the Assembly itself that “it was the most freely elected and most liberal Assembly
France ever possessed”; he tells his motley soldiery that it was “the admiration of the world, and
the finest army France ever possessed”; he tells the provinces that the bombardment of Paris by
him was a myth: “If some cannon-shots have been fired, it was not the deed of the army of
Versailles, but of some insurgents trying to make believe that they are fighting, while they dare
not show their faces.” He again tells the provinces that “the artillery of Versailles does not
bombard Paris, but only cannonades it.” He tells the Archbishop of Paris that the pretended
executions and reprisals (!) attributed to the Versailles troops were all moonshine. He tells Paris
that he was only anxious “to free it from the hideous tyrants who oppress it,” and that, in fact,
the Paris of the Commune was “but a handful of criminals.”

The Paris of M. Thiers was not the real Paris of the “vile multitude,” but a phantom Paris, the
Paris of the francs-fileurs, the Paris of the Boulevards, male and female – the rich, the capitalist,
the gilded, the idle Paris, now thronging with its lackeys, its blacklegs, its literary bohème, and
its cocottes at Versailles, Saint-Denis, Rueil, and Saint-Germain; considering the civil war but
an agreeable diversion, eyeing the battle going on through telescopes, counting the rounds of
cannon, swearing by their own honor and that of their prostitutes, that the performance was far
better got up than it used to be at the Porte St. Martin. The men who fell were really dead; the
cries of the wounded were cries in good earnest; and, besides, the whole thing was so intensely
historical.

This is the Paris of M. Thiers, as the emigration of Coblenz was the France of M. de Calonne.
