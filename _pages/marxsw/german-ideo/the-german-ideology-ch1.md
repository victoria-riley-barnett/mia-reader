## “The German Ideology” Chapter 1 (1845)

### A. Idealism and Materialism

The Illusions of German Ideology

As we hear from German ideologists, Germany has in the last few years gone through an
unparalleled revolution. The decomposition of the Hegelian philosophy, which began with
Strauss, has developed into a universal ferment into which all the ‘powers of the past’ are swept.
In the general chaos mighty empires have arisen only to meet with immediate doom, heroes
have emerged momentarily only to be hurled back into obscurity by bolder and stronger rivals.
It was a revolution beside which the French Revolution was child’s play, a world struggle
beside which the struggles of the Diadochi [successors of Alexander the Great] appear
insignificant. Principles ousted one another, heroes of the mind overthrew each other with
unheard-of rapidity, and in the three years 1842-45 more of the past was swept away in
Germany than at other times in three centuries.

All this is supposed to have taken place in the realm of pure thought.

Certainly it is an interesting event we are dealing with: the putrescence of the absolute spirit.
When the last spark of its life had failed, the various components of this caput mortuum began
to decompose, entered into new combinations and formed new substances. The industrialists of
philosophy, who till then had lived on the exploitation of the absolute spirit, now seized upon
the new combinations. Each with all possible zeal set about retailing his apportioned share. This
naturally gave rise to competition, which, to start with, was carried on in moderately staid
bourgeois fashion. Later when the German market was glutted, and the commodity in spite of all
efforts found no response in the world market, the business was spoiled in the usual German
manner by fabricated and fictitious production, deterioration in quality, adulteration of the raw
materials, falsification of labels, fictitious purchases, bill-jobbing and a credit system devoid of
any real basis. The competition turned into a bitter struggle, which is now being extolled and
interpreted to us as a revolution of world significance, the begetter of the most prodigious
results and achievements.

If we wish to rate at its true value this philosophic charlatanry, which awakens even in the breast
of the honest German citizen a glow of national pride, if we wish to bring out clearly the
pettiness, the parochial narrowness of this whole Young-Hegelian movement and in particular
the tragicomic contrast between the illusions of these heroes about their achievements and the
actual achievements themselves, we must look at the whole spectacle from a standpoint beyond
the frontiers of Germany.

[In the first version of the clean copy there follows a passage, which is crossed out:]

We preface therefore the specific criticism of individual representatives of this movement with a
few general observations, elucidating the ideological premises common to all of them. These
remarks will suffice to indicate the standpoint of our criticism insofar as it is required for the
understanding and the motivation of the subsequent individual criticisms. We oppose these
remarks |p. 3| to Feuerbach in particular because he is the only one who has at least made some
progress and whose works can be examined de bonne foi.

1. Ideology in General, and Especially German Philosophy

A. We know only a single science, the science of history. One can look at history from two sides
and divide it into the history of nature and the history of men. The two sides are, however,
inseparable; the history of nature and the history of men are dependent on each other so long as
men exist. The history of nature, called natural science, does not concern us here; but we will
have to examine the history of men, since almost the whole ideology amounts either to a
distorted conception of this history or to a complete abstraction from it. Ideology is itself only
one of the aspects of this history.


[There follows a passage dealing with the premises of the materialist conception of history. It is
not crossed out and in this volume it is reproduced as Section 2; see pp. 31-32]

Ideology in General, German Ideology in Particular

German criticism has, right up to its latest efforts, never quitted the realm of philosophy. Far
from examining its general philosophic premises, the whole body of its inquiries has actually
sprung from the soil of a definite philosophical system, that of Hegel. Not only in their answers
but in their very questions there was a mystification. This dependence on Hegel is the reason
why not one of these modern critics has even attempted a comprehensive criticism of the
Hegelian system, however much each professes to have advanced beyond Hegel. Their polemics
against Hegel and against one another are confined to this - each extracts one side of the
Hegelian system and turns this against the whole system as well as against the sides extracted by
the others. To begin with they extracted pure unfalsified Hegelian categories such as ‘substance’
and ‘self-consciousness,’ later they desecrated these categories with more secular names such as
species ‘the Unique,’ ‘Man,’ etc.

The entire body of German philosophical criticism from Strauss to Stirner is confined to
criticism of religious conceptions. [The following passage is crossed out in the manuscript:]
claiming to be the absolute redeemer of the world from all evil. Religion was continually
regarded and treated as the arch-enemy, as the ultimate cause of all relations repugnant to these
philosophers. The critics started from real religion and actual theology. What religious
consciousness and a religious conception really meant was determined variously as they went
along. Their advance consisted in subsuming the allegedly dominant metaphysical, political,
juridical, moral and other conceptions under the class of religious or theological conceptions;
and similarly in pronouncing political, juridical, moral consciousness as religious or theological,
and the political, juridical, moral man - ‘man’ in the last resort - as religious. The dominance of
religion was taken for granted. Gradually every dominant relationship was pronounced a
religious relationship and transformed into a cult, a cult of law, a cult of the State, etc. On all
sides it was only a question of dogmas and belief in dogmas. The world was sanctified to an
ever-increasing extent till at last our venerable Saint Max was able to canonise it en bloc and
thus dispose of it once for all.

The Old Hegelians had comprehended everything as soon as it was reduced to an Hegelian
logical category. The Young Hegelians criticised everything by attributing to it religious
conceptions or by pronouncing it a theological matter. The Young Hegelians are in agreement
with the Old Hegelians in their belief in the rule of religion, of concepts, of a universal principle
in the existing world. Only, the one party attacks this dominion as usurpation, while the other
extols it as legitimate.

Since the Young Hegelians consider conceptions, thoughts, ideas, in fact all the products of
consciousness, to which they attribute an independent existence, as the real chains of men (just
as the Old Hegelians declared them the true bonds of human society) it is evident that the Young
Hegelians have to fight only against these illusions of consciousness. Since, according to their
fantasy, the relationships of men, all their doings, their chains and their limitations are products
of their consciousness, the Young Hegelians logically put to men the moral postulate of
exchanging their present consciousness for human, critical or egoistic consciousness, and thus
of removing their limitations. This demand to change consciousness amounts to a demand to
interpret reality in another way, i.e. to recognise it by means of another interpretation. The
Young-Hegelian ideologists, in spite of their allegedly ‘world-shattering’ statements, are the
staunchest conservatives. The most recent of them have found the correct expression for their
activity when they declare they are only fighting against ‘phrases.’ They forget, however, that to
these phrases they themselves are only opposing other phrases, and that they are in no way
combating the real existing world when they are merely combating the phrases of this world.
The only results which this philosophic criticism could achieve were a few (and at that
thoroughly one-sided) elucidations of Christianity from the point of view of religious history; all
the rest of their assertions are only further embellishments of their claim to have furnished, in
these unimportant elucidations, discoveries of universal importance.


It has not occurred to any one of these philosophers to inquire into the connection of German
philosophy with German reality, the relation of their criticism to their own material
surroundings.

First Premises of Materialist Method

The premises from which we begin are not arbitrary ones, not dogmas, but real premises from
which abstraction can only be made in the imagination. They are the real individuals, their
activity and the material conditions under which they live, both those which they find already
existing and those produced by their activity. These premises can thus be verified in a purely
empirical way.

The first premise of all human history is, of course, the existence of living human individuals.
Thus the first fact to be established is the physical organisation of these individuals and their
consequent relation to the rest of nature. Of course, we cannot here go either into the actual
physical nature of man, or into the natural conditions in which man finds himself - geological,
hydrographical, climatic and so on. The writing of history must always set out from these
natural bases and their modification in the course of history through the action of men.

Men can be distinguished from animals by consciousness, by religion or anything else you like.
They themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they begin to produce
their means of subsistence, a step which is conditioned by their physical organisation. By
producing their means of subsistence men are indirectly producing their actual material life.

The way in which men produce their means of subsistence depends first of all on the nature of
the actual means of subsistence they find in existence and have to reproduce. This mode of
production must not be considered simply as being the production of the physical existence of
the individuals. Rather it is a definite form of activity of these individuals, a definite form of
expressing their life, a definite mode of life on their part. As individuals express their life, so
they are. What they are, therefore, coincides with their production, both with what they produce
and with how they produce. The nature of individuals thus depends on the material conditions
determining their production.

This production only makes its appearance with the increase of population. In its turn this
presupposes the intercourse [Verkehr] of individuals with one another. The form of this
intercourse is again determined by production.

```
[3. Production and Intercourse.
Division of Labour and Forms of Property - Tribal, Ancient, Feudal]
```
The relations of different nations among themselves depend upon the extent to which each has
developed its productive forces, the division of labour and internal intercourse. This statement is
generally recognised. But not only the relation of one nation to others, but also the whole
internal structure of the nation itself depends on the stage of development reached by its
production and its internal and external intercourse. How far the productive forces of a nation
are developed is shown most manifestly by the degree to which the division of labour has been
carried. Each new productive force, insofar as it is not merely a quantitative extension of
productive forces already known (for instance the bringing into cultivation of fresh land), causes
a further development of the division of labour.

The division of labour inside a nation leads at first to the separation of industrial and
commercial from agricultural labour, and hence to the separation of town and country and to the
conflict of their interests. Its further development leads to the separation of commercial from
industrial labour. At the same time through the division of labour inside these various branches
there develop various divisions among the individuals co-operating in definite kinds of labour.
The relative position of these individual groups is determined by the methods employed in
agriculture, industry and commerce (patriarchalism, slavery, estates, classes). These same
conditions are to be seen (given a more developed intercourse) in the relations of different
nations to one another.

The various stages of development in the division of labour are just so many different forms of
ownership, i.e. the existing stage in the division of labour determines also the relations of
individuals to one another with reference to the material, instrument, and product of labour.


The first form of ownership is tribal [Stammeigentum] ownership. It corresponds to the
undeveloped stage of production, at which a people lives by hunting and fishing, by the rearing
of beasts or, in the highest stage, agriculture. In the latter case it presupposes a great mass of
uncultivated stretches of land. The division of labour is at this stage still very elementary and is
confined to a further extension of the natural division of labour existing in the family. The social
structure is, therefore, limited to an extension of the family; patriarchal family chieftains, below
them the members of the tribe, finally slaves. The slavery latent in the family only develops
gradually with the increase of population, the growth of wants, and with the extension of
external relations, both of war and of barter.

The second form is the ancient communal and State ownership which proceeds especially from
the union of several tribes into a city by agreement or by conquest, and which is still
accompanied by slavery. Beside communal ownership we already find movable, and later also
immovable, private property developing, but as an abnormal form subordinate to communal
ownership. The citizens hold power over their labouring slaves only in their community, and on
this account alone, therefore, they are bound to the form of communal ownership. It is the
communal private property which compels the active citizens to remain in this spontaneously
derived form of association over against their slaves. For this reason the whole structure of
society based on this communal ownership, and with it the power of the people, decays in the
same measure as, in particular, immovable private property evolves. The division of labour is
already more developed. We already find the antagonism of town and country; later the
antagonism between those states which represent town interests and those which represent
country interests, and inside the towns themselves the antagonism between industry and
maritime commerce. The class relation between citizens and slaves is now completely
developed.

With the development of private property, we find here for the first time the same conditions
which we shall find again, only on a more extensive scale, with modern private property. On the
one hand, the concentration of private property, which began very early in Rome (as the
Licinian agrarian law proves) and proceeded very rapidly from the time of the civil wars and
especially under the Emperors; on the other hand, coupled with this, the transformation of the
plebeian small peasantry into a proletariat, which, however, owing to its intermediate position
between propertied citizens and slaves, never achieved an independent development.

The third form of ownership is feudal or estate property. If antiquity started out from the town
and its little territory, the Middle Ages started out from the country. This different starting-point
was determined by the sparseness of the population at that time, which was scattered over a
large area and which received no large increase from the conquerors. In contrast to Greece and
Rome, feudal development at the outset, therefore, extends over a much wider territory,
prepared by the Roman conquests and the spread of agriculture at first associated with it. The
last centuries of the declining Roman Empire and its conquest by the barbarians destroyed a
number of productive forces; agriculture had declined, industry had decayed for want of a
market, trade had died out or been violently suspended, the rural and urban population had
decreased. From these conditions and the mode of organisation of the conquest determined by
them, feudal property developed under the influence of the Germanic military constitution. Like
tribal and communal ownership, it is based again on a community; but the directly producing
class standing over against it is not, as in the case of the ancient community, the slaves, but the
enserfed small peasantry. As soon as feudalism is fully developed, there also arises antagonism
to the towns. The hierarchical structure of land ownership, and the armed bodies of retainers
associated with it, gave the nobility power over the serfs. This feudal organisation was, just as
much as the ancient communal ownership, an association against a subjected producing class;
but the form of association and the relation to the direct producers were different because of the
different conditions of production.

This feudal system of land ownership had its counterpart in the towns in the shape of
corporative property, the feudal organisation of trades. Here property consisted chiefly in the
labour of each individual person. The necessity for association against the organised robber-
nobility, the need for communal covered markets in an age when the industrialist was at the
same time a merchant, the growing competition of the escaped serfs swarming into the rising
towns, the feudal structure of the whole country: these combined to bring about the guilds. The


gradually accumulated small capital of individual craftsmen and their stable numbers, as against
the growing population, evolved the relation of journeyman and apprentice, which brought into
being in the towns a hierarchy similar to that in the country.

Thus the chief form of property during the feudal epoch consisted on the one hand of landed
property with serf labour chained to it, and on the other of the labour of the individual with
small capital commanding the labour of journeymen. The organisation of both was determined
by the restricted conditions of production - the small-scale and primitive cultivation of the land,
and the craft type of industry. There was little division of labour in the heyday of feudalism.
Each country bore in itself the antithesis of town and country; the division into estates was
certainly strongly marked; but apart from the differentiation of princes, nobility, clergy and
peasants in the country, and masters, journeymen, apprentices and soon also the rabble of casual
labourers in the towns, no division of importance took place. In agriculture it was rendered
difficult by the strip-system, beside which the cottage industry of the peasants themselves
emerged. In industry there was no division of labour at all in the individual trades themselves,
and very little between them. The separation of industry and commerce was found already in
existence in older towns; in the newer it only developed later, when the towns entered into
mutual relations.

The grouping of larger territories into feudal kingdoms was a necessity for the landed nobility as
for the towns. The organisation of the ruling class, the nobility, had, therefore, everywhere a
monarch at its head.

```
[4. The Essence of the Materialist Conception of History.
Social Being and Social Consciousness]
```
The fact is, therefore, that definite individuals who are productively active in a definite way
enter into these definite social and political relations. Empirical observation must in each
separate instance bring out empirically, and without any mystification and speculation, the
connection of the social and political structure with production. The social structure and the
State are continually evolving out of the life-process of definite individuals, but of individuals,
not as they may appear in their own or other people’s imagination, but as they really are; i.e. as
they operate, produce materially, and hence as they work under definite material limits,
presuppositions and conditions independent of their will.

[The following passage is crossed out in the manuscript:] The ideas which these individuals
form are ideas either about their relation to nature or about their mutual relations or about their
own nature. It is evident that in all these cases their ideas are the conscious expression - real or
illusory - of their real relations and activities, of their production, of their intercourse, of their
social and political conduct. The opposite assumption is only possible if in addition to the spirit
of the real, materially evolved individuals a separate spirit is presupposed. If the conscious
expression of the real relations of these individuals is illusory, if in their imagination they turn
reality upside-down, then this in its turn is the result of their limited material mode of activity
and their limited social relations arising from it.

The production of ideas, of conceptions, of consciousness, is at first directly interwoven with the
material activity and the material intercourse of men, the language of real life. Conceiving,
thinking, the mental intercourse of men, appear at this stage as the direct efflux of their material
behaviour. The same applies to mental production as expressed in the language of politics, laws,
morality, religion, metaphysics, etc., of a people. Men are the producers of their conceptions,
ideas, etc. - real, active men, as they are conditioned by a definite development of their
productive forces and of the intercourse corresponding to these, up to its furthest forms.
Consciousness can never be anything else than conscious existence, and the existence of men is
their actual life-process. If in all ideology men and their circumstances appear upside-down as in
a camera obscura, this phenomenon arises just as much from their historical life-process as the
inversion of objects on the retina does from their physical life-process.

In direct contrast to German philosophy which descends from heaven to earth, here we ascend
from earth to heaven. That is to say, we do not set out from what men say, imagine, conceive,
nor from men as narrated, thought of, imagined, conceived, in order to arrive at men in the flesh.
We set out from real, active men, and on the basis of their real life-process we demonstrate the


development of the ideological reflexes and echoes of this life-process. The phantoms formed in
the human brain are also, necessarily, sublimates of their material life-process, which is
empirically verifiable and bound to material premises. Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the
rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness, thus no longer retain the
semblance of independence. They have no history, no development; but men, developing their
material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with this their real existence,
their thinking and the products of their thinking. Life is not determined by consciousness, but
consciousness by life. In the first method of approach the starting-point is consciousness taken
as the living individual; in the second method, which conforms to real life, it is the real living
individuals themselves, and consciousness is considered solely as their consciousness.

This method of approach is not devoid of premises. It starts out from the real premises and does
not abandon them for a moment. Its premises are men, not in any fantastic isolation and rigidity,
but in their actual, empirically perceptible process of development under definite conditions. As
soon as this active life-process is described, history ceases to be a collection of dead facts as it is
with the empiricists (themselves still abstract), or an imagined activity of imagined subjects, as
with the idealists.

Where speculation ends - in real life - there real, positive science begins: the representation of
the practical activity, of the practical process of development of men. Empty talk about
consciousness ceases, and real knowledge has to take its place. When reality is depicted,
philosophy as an independent branch of knowledge loses its medium of existence. At the best its
place can only be taken by a summing-up of the most general results, abstractions which arise
from the observation of the historical development of men. Viewed apart from real history,
these abstractions have in themselves no value whatsoever. They can only serve to facilitate the
arrangement of historical material, to indicate the sequence of its separate strata. But they by no
means afford a recipe or schema, as does philosophy, for neatly trimming the epochs of history.
On the contrary, our difficulties begin only when we set about the observation and the
arrangement - the real depiction - of our historical material, whether of a past epoch or of the
present. The removal of these difficulties is governed by premises which it is quite impossible to
state here, but which only the study of the actual life-process and the activity of the individuals
of each epoch will make evident. We shall select here some of these abstractions, which we use
in contradistinction to the ideologists, and shall illustrate them by historical examples.

History: Fundamental Conditions

Since we are dealing with the Germans, who are devoid of premises, we must begin by stating
the first premise of all human existence and, therefore, of all history, the premise, namely, that
men must be in a position to live in order to be able to ‘make history.’ But life involves before
everything else eating and drinking, a habitation, clothing and many other things. The first
historical act is thus the production of the means to satisfy these needs, the production of
material life itself. And indeed this is an historical act, a fundamental condition of all history,
which today, as thousands of years ago, must daily and hourly be fulfilled merely in order to
sustain human life. Even when the sensuous world is reduced to a minimum, to a stick as with
Saint Bruno [Bauer], it presupposes the action of producing the stick. Therefore in any
interpretation of history one has first of all to observe this fundamental fact in all its significance
and all its implications and to accord it its due importance. It is well known that the Germans
have never done this, and they have never, therefore, had an earthly basis for history and
consequently never an historian. The French and the English, even if they have conceived the
relation of this fact with so-called history only in an extremely one-sided fashion, particularly as
long as they remained in the toils of political ideology, have nevertheless made the first attempts
to give the writing of history a materialistic basis by being the first to write histories of civil
society, of commerce and industry.

The second point is that the satisfaction of the first need (the action of satisfying, and the
instrument of satisfaction which has been acquired) leads to new needs; and this production of
new needs is the first historical act. Here we recognise immediately the spiritual ancestry of the
great historical wisdom of the Germans who, when they run out of positive material and when
they can serve up neither theological nor political nor literary rubbish, assert that this is not
history at all, but the ‘prehistoric era.’ They do not, however, enlighten us as to how we proceed


from this nonsensical ‘prehistory’ to history proper; although, on the other hand, in their
historical speculation they seize upon this ‘prehistory’ with especial eagerness because they
imagine themselves safe there from interference on the part of ‘crude facts,’ and, at the same
time, because there they can give full rein to their speculative impulse and set up and knock
down hypotheses by the thousand.

The third circumstance which, from the very outset, enters into historical development, is that
men, who daily remake their own life, begin to make other men, to propagate their kind: the
relation between man and woman, parents and children, the family. The family, which to begin
with is the only social relationship, becomes later, when increased needs create new social
relations and the increased population new needs, a subordinate one (except in Germany), and
must then be treated and analysed according to the existing empirical data, not according to ‘the
concept of the family,’ as is the custom in
Germany.http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm - 1#

[Note by Marx: 1. The building of houses. With savages each family has as a matter of
course its own cave or hut like the separate family tent of the nomads. This separate
domestic economy is made only the more necessary by the further development of private
property. With the agricultural peoples a communal domestic economy is just as
impossible as a communal cultivation of the soil. A great advance was the building of
towns. In all previous periods, however, the abolition of individual economy, which is
inseparable from the abolition of private property, was impossible for the simple reason
that the material conditions governing it were not present. The setting-up of a communal
domestic economy presupposes the development of machinery, of the use of natural
forces and of many other productive forces - e.g. of water-supplies, of gas-lighting,
steam-heating, etc., the removal [of the antagonism] of town and country. Without these
conditions a communal economy would not in itself form a new productive force; lacking
any material basis and resting on a purely theoretical foundation, it would be a mere freak
and would end in nothing more than a monastic economy - What was possible can be
seen in the towns brought about by condensation and the erection of communal buildings
for various definite purposes (prisons, barracks, etc.). That the abolition of individual
economy is inseparable from the abolition of the family is self-evident.]

These three aspects of social activity are not of course to be taken as three different stages, but
just as three aspects or, to make it clear to the Germans, three ‘moments,’ which have existed
simultaneously since the dawn of history and the first men, and which still assert themselves in
history today.

The production of life, both of one’s own in labour and of fresh life in procreation, now appears
as a double relationship: on the one hand as a natural, on the other as a social relationship. By
social we understand the co-operation of several individuals, no matter under what conditions,
in what manner and to what end. It follows from this that a certain mode of production, or
industrial stage, is always combined with a certain mode of co-operation, or social stage, and
this mode of co-operation is itself a ‘productive force.’ Further, that the multitude of productive
forces accessible to men determines the nature of society, hence, that the ‘history of humanity’
must always be studied and treated in relation to the history of industry and exchange. But it is
also clear how in Germany it is impossible to write this sort of history, because the Germans
lack not only the necessary power of comprehension and the material but also the ‘evidence of
their senses,’ for across the Rhine you cannot have any experience of these things since history
has stopped happening. Thus it is quite obvious from the start that there exists a materialistic
connection of men with one another, which is determined by their needs and their mode of
production, and which is as old as men themselves. This connection is ever taking on new
forms, and thus presents a ‘history’ independently of the existence of any political or religious
nonsense which in addition may hold men together.

Only now, after having considered four moments, four aspects of the primary historical
relationships, do we find that man also possesses ‘consciousness,’ but, even so, not inherent, not
‘pure’ consciousness. From the start the ‘spirit’ is afflicted with the curse of being ‘burdened’
with matter, which here makes its appearance in the form of agitated layers of air, sounds, in
short, of language. Language is as old as consciousness, language is practical consciousness that
exists also for other men, [Marx struck out: ‘Mein Verhältnis zu meiner Umgebung ist mein


Bewußtsein,’ i.e., ‘My relation to my environment is my
consciousness.’]http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm

- A#A and for that reason alone it really exists for me personally as well; language, like
consciousness, only arises from the need, the necessity, of intercourse with other men. Where
there exists a relationship, it exists for me: the animal does not enter into ‘relations’ with
anything, it does not enter into any relation at all. For the animal, its relation to others does not
exist as a relation. Consciousness is, therefore, from the very beginning a social product, and
remains so as long as men exist at all. Consciousness is at first, of course, merely consciousness
concerning the immediate sensuous environment and consciousness of the limited connection
with other persons and things outside the individual who is growing self-conscious. At the same
time it is consciousness of nature, which first appears to men as a completely alien, all-powerful
and unassailable force, with which men’s relations are purely animal and by which they are
overawed like beasts; it is thus a purely animal consciousness of nature (natural religion) just
because nature is as yet hardly modified historically. (We see here immediately: this natural
religion or this particular relation of men to nature is determined by the form of society and vice
versa. Here, as everywhere, the identity of nature and man appears in such a way that the
restricted relation of men to nature determines their restricted relation to one another, and their
restricted relation to one another determines men’s restricted relation to nature.) On the other
hand, man’s consciousness of the necessity of associating with the individuals around him is the
beginning of the consciousness that he is living in society at all. This beginning is as animal as
social life itself at this stage. It is mere herd-consciousness, and at this point man is only
distinguished from sheep by the fact that with him consciousness takes the place of instinct or
that his instinct is a conscious one. This sheep-like or tribal consciousness receives its further
development and extension through increased productivity, the increase of needs, and, what is
fundamental to both of these, the increase of population. With these there develops the division
of labour, which was originally nothing but the division of labour in the sexual act, then that
division of labour which develops spontaneously or ‘naturally’ by virtue of natural
predisposition (e.g. physical strength), needs, accidents, etc. etc. Division of labour only
becomes truly such from the moment when a division of material and mental labour appears.
(The first form of ideologists, priests, is concurrent.) From this moment onwards consciousness
can really flatter itself that it is something other than consciousness of existing practice, that it
really represents something without representing something real; from now on consciousness is
in a position to emancipate itself from the world and to proceed to the formation of ‘pure’
theory, theology, philosophy, ethics, etc. But even if this theory, theology, philosophy, ethics,
etc. comes into contradiction with the existing relations, this can only occur because existing
social relations have come into contradiction with existing forces of production; this, moreover,
can also occur in a particular national sphere of relations through the appearance of the
contradiction, not within the national orbit, but between this national consciousness and the
practice of other nations, i.e. between the national and the general consciousness of a nation (as
we see it now in Germany).

Moreover, it is quite immaterial what consciousness starts to do on its own: out of all such muck
we get only the one inference that these three moments, the forces of production, the state of
society, and consciousness, can and must come into contradiction with one another, because the
division of labour implies the possibility, nay the fact that intellectual and material activity -
enjoyment and labour, production and consumption - devolve on different individuals, and that
the only possibility of their not coming into contradiction lies in the negation in its turn of the
division of labour. It is self-evident, moreover, that ‘spectres,’ ‘bonds,’ ‘the higher being,’
‘concept,’ ‘scruple,’ are merely the idealistic, spiritual expression, the conception apparently of
the isolated individual, the image of very empirical fetters and limitations, within which the
mode of production of life and the form of intercourse coupled with it move.

Private Property and Communism

With the division of labour, in which all these contradictions are implicit, and which in its turn
is based on the natural division of labour in the family and the separation of society into
individual families opposed to one another, is given simultaneously the distribution, and indeed
the unequal distribution, both quantitative and qualitative, of labour and its products, hence


property: the nucleus, the first form, of which lies in the family, where wife and children are the
slaves of the husband. This latent slavery in the family, though still very crude, is the first
property, but even at this early stage it corresponds perfectly to the definition of modern
economists who call it the power of disposing of the labour-power of others. Division of labour
and private property are, moreover, identical expressions: in the one the same thing is affirmed
with reference to activity as is affirmed in the other with reference to the product of the activity.

[Note by Marx: Further, the division of labour implies the contradiction between the
interest of the separate individual or the individual family and the communal interest of
all individuals who have intercourse with one another. And indeed, this communal
interest does not exist merely in the imagination, as the ‘general interest,’ but first of all
in reality, as the mutual interdependence of the individuals among whom the labour is
divided. And finally, the division of labour offers us the first example of how, as long as
man remains in natural society, that is, as long as a cleavage exists between the particular
and the common interest, as long, therefore, as activity is not voluntarily, but naturally,
divided, man’s own deed becomes an alien power opposed to him, which enslaves him
instead of being controlled by him. For as soon as the distribution of labour comes into
being, each man has a particular, exclusive sphere of activity, which is forced upon him
and from which he cannot escape. He is a hunter, a fisherman, a herdsman, or a critical
critic, and must remain so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood; while in
communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can
become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production
and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in
the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I
have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic. This fixation
of social activity, this consolidation of what we ourselves produce into an objective
power above us, growing out of our control, thwarting our expectations, bringing to
naught our calculations, is one of the chief factors in historical development up till now.]

[This paragraph appears as a marginal note in the manuscript.] And out of this very
contradiction between the interest of the individual and that of the community the latter
takes an independent form as the State, divorced from the real interests of individual and
community, and at the same time as an illusory communal life, always based, however,
on the real ties existing in every family and tribal conglomeration - such as flesh and
blood, language, division of labour on a larger scale, and other interests - and especially,
as we shall enlarge upon later, on the classes, already determined by the division of
labour, which in every such mass of men separate out, and of which one dominates all the
others. It follows from this that all struggles within the State, the struggle between
democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy, the struggle for the franchise, etc., etc., are merely
the illusory forms in which the real struggles of the different classes are fought out among
one another (of this the German theoreticians have not the faintest inkling, although they
have received a sufficient introduction to the subject in the Deutsch-Französische
Jahrbücher and Die heilige Familie). Further, it follows that every class which is
struggling for mastery, even when its domination, as is the case with the proletariat,
postulates the abolition of the old form of society in its entirety and of domination itself,
must first conquer for itself political power in order to represent its interest in turn as the
general interest, which in the first moment it is forced to do. Just because individuals seek
only their particular interest, which for them does not coincide with their communal
interest (in fact the general is the illusory form of communal life), the latter will be
imposed on them as an interest ‘alien’ to them, and ‘independent’ of them as in its turn a
particular, peculiar ‘general’ interest; or they themselves must remain within this discord,
as in democracy. On the other hand, too, the practical struggle of these particular
interests, which constantly really run counter to the communal and illusory communal
interests, makes practical intervention and control necessary through the illusory
‘general’ interest in the form of the State.

The social power, i.e., the multiplied productive force, which arises through the co-operation of
different individuals as it is determined by the division of labour, appears to these individuals,
since their co-operation is not voluntary but has come about naturally, not as their own united


power, but as an alien force existing outside them, of the origin and goal of which they are
ignorant, which they thus cannot control, which on the contrary passes through a peculiar series
of phases and stages independent of the will and the action of man, nay even being the prime
governor of these.

How otherwise could, for instance, property have had a history at all, have taken on different
forms, and landed property, for example, according to the different premises given, have
proceeded in France from parcellation to centralisation in the hands of a few, in England from
centralisation in the hands of a few to parcellation, as is actually the case today? Or how does it
happen that trade, which after all is nothing more than the exchange of products of various
individuals and countries, rules the whole world through the relation of supply and demand - a
relation which, as an English economist says, hovers over the earth like the fate of the ancients,
and with invisible hand allots fortune and misfortune to men, sets up empires and overthrows
empires, causes nations to rise and to disappear - while with the abolition of the basis of private
property, with the communistic regulation of production (and, implicit in this, the destruction of
the alien relation between men and what they themselves produce), the power of the relation of
supply and demand is dissolved into nothing, and men get exchange, production, the mode of
their mutual relation, under their own control again?

History as a Continuous Process

In history up to the present it is certainly an empirical fact that separate individuals have, with
the broadening of their activity into world-historical activity, become more and more enslaved
under a power alien to them (a pressure which they have conceived of as a dirty trick on the part
of the so-called universal spirit, etc.), a power which has become more and more enormous and,
in the last instance, turns out to be the world market. But it is just as empirically established
that, by the overthrow of the existing state of society by the communist revolution (of which
more below) and the abolition of private property which is identical with it, this power, which
so baffles the German theoreticians, will be dissolved; and that then the liberation of each single
individual will be accomplished in the measure in which history becomes transformed into
world history. From the above it is clear that the real intellectual wealth of the individual
depends entirely on the wealth of his real connections. Only then will the separate individuals be
liberated from the various national and local barriers, be brought into practical connection with
the material and intellectual production of the whole world and be put in a position to acquire
the capacity to enjoy this all-sided production of the whole earth (the creations of man). All-
round dependence, this natural form of the world-historical co-operation of individuals, will be
transformed by this communist revolution into the control and conscious mastery of these
powers, which, born of the action of men on one another, have till now overawed and governed
men as powers completely alien to them. Now this view can be expressed again in speculative-
idealistic, i.e. fantastic, terms as ‘self-generation of the species’ (‘society as the subject’), and
thereby the consecutive series of interrelated individuals connected with each other can be
conceived as a single individual, which accomplishes the mystery of generating itself. It is clear
here that individuals certainly make one another, physically and mentally, but do not make
themselves.

[5. Development of the Productive Forces as a Material Premise of
Communism]
```
This ‘alienation’ (to use a term which will be comprehensible to the philosophers) can, of
course, only be abolished given two practical premises. For it to become an ‘intolerable’ power,
i.e. a power against which men make a revolution, it must necessarily have rendered the great
mass of humanity ‘propertyless,’ and produced, at the same time, the contradiction of an
existing world of wealth and culture, both of which conditions presuppose a great increase in
productive power, a high degree of its development. And, on the other hand, this development
of productive forces (which itself implies the actual empirical existence of men in their world-
historical, instead of local, being) is an absolutely necessary practical premise because without it
want is merely made general, and with destitution the struggle for necessities and all the old
filthy business would necessarily be reproduced; and furthermore, because only with this
universal development of productive forces is a universal intercourse between men established,


which produces in all nations simultaneously the phenomenon of the ‘propertyless’ mass
(universal competition), makes each nation dependent on the revolutions of the others, and
finally has put world-historical, empirically universal individuals in place of local ones. Without
this, (1) communism could only exist as a local event; (2) the forces of intercourse themselves
could not have developed as universal, hence intolerable powers: they would have remained
home-bred conditions surrounded by superstition; and (3) each extension of intercourse would
abolish local communism. Empirically, communism is only possible as the act of the dominant
peoples ‘all at once’ and simultaneously, which presupposes the universal development of
productive forces and the world intercourse bound up with communism. Moreover, the mass of
propertyless workers - the utterly precarious position of labour - power on a mass scale cut off
from capital or from even a limited satisfaction and, therefore, no longer merely temporarily
deprived of work itself as a secure source of life - presupposes the world market through
competition. The proletariat can thus only exist world-historically, just as communism, its
activity, can only have a ‘world-historical’ existence. World-historical existence of individuals
means existence of individuals which is directly linked up with world history.

Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality
[will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present
state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence.

In the main we have so far considered only one aspect of human activity, the reshaping of
nature by men. The other aspect, the reshaping of men by men ... [Intercourse and productive
