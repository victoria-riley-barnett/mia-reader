### B. The Illusion of the Epoch

Civil Society and the Conception of History

The form of intercourse determined by the existing productive forces at all previous historical
stages, and in its turn determining these, is civil society. The latter, as is clear from what we
have said above, has as its premises and basis the simple family and the multiple, the so-called
tribe, the more precise determinants of this society are enumerated in our remarks above.
Already here we see how this civil society is the true source and theatre of all history, and how
absurd is the conception of history held hitherto, which neglects the real relationships and
confines itself to high-sounding dramas of princes and states.

Civil society embraces the whole material intercourse of individuals within a definite stage of
the development of productive forces. It embraces the whole commercial and industrial life of a
given stage and, insofar, transcends the State and the nation, though, on the other hand again, it
must assert itself in its foreign relations as nationality, and inwardly must organise itself as
State. The word ‘civil society’ [bürgerliche Gesellschaft] emerged in the eighteenth century,
when property relationships had already extricated themselves from the ancient and medieval
communal society. Civil society as such only develops with the bourgeoisie; the social
organisation evolving directly out of production and commerce, which in all ages forms the
basis of the State and of the rest of the idealistic superstructure, has, however, always been
designated by the same name.

Conclusions from the Materialist Conception of History

History is nothing but the succession of the separate generations, each of which exploits the
materials, the capital funds, the productive forces handed down to it by all preceding
generations, and thus, on the one hand, continues the traditional activity in completely changed
circumstances and, on the other, modifies the old circumstances with a completely changed
activity. This can be speculatively distorted so that later history is made the goal of earlier
history, e.g. the goal ascribed to the discovery of America is to further the eruption of the
French Revolution. Thereby history receives its own special aims and becomes ‘a person rating
with other persons’ (to wit: ‘Self-Consciousness, Criticism, the Unique,’ etc.), while what is
designated with the words ‘destiny,’ ‘goal,’ ‘germ,’ or ‘idea’ of earlier history is nothing more


than an abstraction formed from later history, from the active influence which earlier history
exercises on later history.

The further the separate spheres, which interact on one another, extend in the course of this
development, the more the original isolation of the separate nationalities is destroyed by the
developed mode of production and intercourse and the division of labour between various
nations naturally brought forth by these, the more history becomes world history. Thus, for
instance, if in England a machine is invented, which deprives countless workers of bread in
India and China, and overturns the whole form of existence of these empires, this invention
becomes a world-historical fact. Or again, take the case of sugar and coffee which have proved
their world-historical importance in the nineteenth century by the fact that the lack of these
products, occasioned by the Napoleonic Continental System, caused the Germans to rise against
Napoleon, and thus became the real basis of the glorious Wars of liberation of 1813. From this it
follows that this transformation of history into world history is not indeed a mere abstract act on
the part of the ‘self-consciousness,’ the world spirit, or of any other metaphysical spectre, but a
quite material, empirically verifiable act, an act the proof of which every individual furnishes as
he comes and goes, eats, drinks and clothes himself.

[7. Summary of the Materialist Conception of History]

This conception of history depends on our ability to expound the real process of production,
starting out from the material production of life itself, and to comprehend the form of
intercourse connected with this and created by this mode of production (i.e. civil society in its
various stages), as the basis of all history; and to show it in its action as State, to explain all the
different theoretical products and forms of consciousness, religion, philosophy, ethics, etc. etc.
and trace their origins and growth from that basis; by which means, of course, the whole thing
can be depicted in its totality (and therefore, too, the reciprocal action of these various sides on
one another). It has not, like the idealistic view of history, in every period to look for a category,
but remains constantly on the real ground of history; it does not explain practice from the idea
but explains the formation of ideas from material practice; and accordingly it comes to the
conclusion that all forms and products of consciousness cannot be dissolved by mental criticism,
by resolution into ‘self-consciousness’ or transformation into ‘apparitions,’ ‘spectres,’ ‘fancies,’
etc. but only by the practical overthrow of the actual social relations which gave rise to this
idealistic humbug; that not criticism but revolution is the driving force of history, also of
religion, of philosophy and all other types of theory. It shows that history does not end by being
resolved into ‘self-consciousness as spirit of the spirit,’ but that in it at each stage there is found
a material result: a sum of productive forces, an historically created relation of individuals to
nature and to one another, which is handed down to each generation from its predecessor; a
mass of productive forces, capital funds and conditions, which, on the one hand, is indeed
modified by the new generation, but also on the other prescribes for it its conditions of life and
gives it a definite development, a special character. It shows that circumstances make men just
as much as men make circumstances.

This sum of productive forces, capital funds and social forms of intercourse, which every
individual and generation finds in existence as something given, is the real basis of what the
philosophers have conceived as ‘substance’ and ‘essence of man,’ and what they have deified
and attacked; a real basis which is not in the least disturbed, in its effect and influence on the
development of men, by the fact that these philosophers revolt against it as ‘self-consciousness’
and the ‘Unique.’ These conditions of life, which different generations find in existence, decide
also whether or not the periodically recurring revolutionary convulsion will be strong enough to
overthrow the basis of the entire existing system. And if these material elements of a complete
revolution are not present (namely, on the one hand the existing productive forces, on the other
the formation of a revolutionary mass, which revolts not only against separate conditions of
society up till then, but against the very ‘production of life’ till then, the ‘total activity’ on which
it was based), then, as far as practical development is concerned, it is absolutely immaterial
whether the idea of this revolution has been expressed a hundred times already, as the history of
communism proves.


```
[8. The Inconsistency of the Idealist Conception of History in General,
and of German Post-Hegelian Philosophy in Particular]
```
In the whole conception of history up to the present this real basis of history has either been
totally neglected or else considered as a minor matter quite irrelevant to the course of history.
History must, therefore, always be written according to an extraneous standard; the real
production of life seems to be primeval history, while the truly historical appears to be separated
from ordinary life, something extra-superterrestrial. With this the relation of man to nature is
excluded from history and hence the antithesis of nature and history is created. The exponents of
this conception of history have consequently only been able to see in history the political actions
of princes and States, religious and all sorts of theoretical struggles, and in particular in each
historical epoch have had to share the illusion of that epoch. For instance, if an epoch imagines
itself to be actuated by purely ‘political’ or ‘religious’ motives, although ‘religion’ and ‘politics’
are only forms of its true motives, the historian accepts this opinion. The ‘idea,’ the ‘conception’
of the people in question about their real practice, is transformed into the sole determining,
active force, which controls and determines their practice. When the crude form in which the
division of labour appears with the Indians and Egyptians calls forth the caste-system in their
State and religion, the historian believes that the caste-system is the power which has produced
this crude social form.

While the French and the English at least hold by the political illusion, which is moderately
close to reality, the Germans move in the realm of the ‘pure spirit,’ and make religious illusion
the driving force of history. The Hegelian philosophy of history is the last consequence, reduced
to its ‘finest expression,’ of all this German historiography, for which it is not a question of real,
nor even of political, interests, but of pure thoughts, which consequently must appear to Saint
Bruno as a series of ‘thoughts’ that devour one another and are finally swallowed up in ‘self-
consciousness.’ -

[Marginal note by Marx: So-called objective historiography consisted precisely, in treating the
historical relations separately from activity. Reactionary character.]

- and even more consistently the course of history must appear to Saint Max Stirner, who
knows not a thing about real history, as a mere ‘tale of knights, robbers and ghosts,’ from whose
visions he can, of course, only save himself by ‘unholiness’. This conception is truly religious: it
postulates religious man as the primitive man, the starting-point of history, and in its
imagination puts the religious production of fancies in the place of the real production of the
means of subsistence and of life itself.

This whole conception of history, together with its dissolution and the scruples and qualms
resulting from it, is a purely national affair of the Germans and has merely local interest for
Germany, as for instance the important question which has been under discussion in recent
times: how exactly one ‘passes from the realm of God to the realm of Man’[Ludwig Feuerbach,
Ueber das Wesen des Christenthums] - as if this ‘realm of God’ had ever existed anywhere save
in the imagination, and the learned gentlemen, without being aware of it, were not constantly
living in the ‘realm of Man’ to which they are now seeking the way; and as if the learned
pastime (for it is nothing more) of explaining the mystery of this theoretical bubble-blowing did
not on the contrary lie in demonstrating its origin in actual earthly relations. For these Germans,
it is altogether simply a matter of resolving the ready-made nonsense they find into some other
freak, i.e., of presupposing that all this nonsense has a special sense which can be discovered;
while really it is only a question of explaining these theoretical phrases from the actual existing
relations. The real, practical dissolution of these phrases, the removal of these notions from the
consciousness of men, will, as we have already said, be effected by altered circumstances, not
by theoretical deductions. For the mass of men, i.e., the proletariat, these theoretical notions do
not exist and hence do not require to be dissolved, and if this mass ever had any theoretical
notions, e.g., religion, these have now long been dissolved by circumstances.

The purely national character of these questions and solutions is moreover shown by the fact
that these theorists believe in all seriousness that chimeras like ‘the God-Man,’ ‘Man,’ etc., have
presided over individual epochs of history (Saint Bruno even goes so far as to assert that only
‘criticism and critics have made history,’[Bruno Bauer, Charakteristik Ludwig Feuerbachs]and
when they themselves construct historical systems, they skip over all earlier periods in the


greatest haste and pass immediately from ‘Mongolism’[Max Stirner, Der Einzige und sein
Eigenthum] to history ‘with meaningful content,’ that is to say, to the history, of the Hallische
and Deutsche Jahrbücher and the dissolution of the Hegelian school into a general squabble.
They forget all other nations, all real events, and the theatrum mundi is confined to the Leipzig
book fair and the mutual quarrels of ‘criticism,’[Bruno Bauer] ‘man,’[Ludwig Feuerbach] and
‘the unique’.[Max Stirner] If for once these theorists treat really historical subjects, as for
instance the eighteenth century, they merely give a history of ideas, separated from the facts and
the practical development underlying them; and even that merely in order to represent that
period as an imperfect preliminary stage, the as yet limited predecessor of the truly historical
age, i.e., the period of the German philosophic struggle from 1840 to 1844. As might be
expected when the history of an earlier period is written with the aim of accentuating the
brilliance of an unhistoric person and his fantasies, all the really historic events, even the really
historic interventions of politics in history, receive no mention. Instead we get a narrative based
not on research but on arbitrary constructions and literary gossip, such as Saint Bruno provided
in his now forgotten history of the eighteenth century. [Bruno Bauer, Geschichte der Politik,
Cultur und Aufklärung des achtzehnten Jahrhunderts] These pompous and arrogant hucksters of
ideas, who imagine themselves infinitely exalted above all national prejudices, are thus in
practice far more national than the beer-swilling philistines who dream of a united Germany.
They do not recognise the deeds of other nations as historical; they live in Germany, within
Germany 1281 and for Germany; they turn the Rhine-song into a religious hymn and conquer
Alsace and Lorraine by robbing French philosophy instead of the French state, by Germanising
French ideas instead of French provinces. Herr Venedey is a cosmopolitan compared with the
Saints Bruno and Max, who, in the universal dominance of theory, proclaim the universal
dominance of Germany.

Feuerbach: Philosophic, and Real, Liberation

[...] It is also clear from these arguments how grossly Feuerbach is deceiving himself when
(Wigand’s Vierteljahrsschrift, 1845, Band 2) by virtue of the qualification ‘common man’ he
declares himself a
communist,http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/cw/volume05/footnote.htm - 26
transforms the latter into a predicate of ‘man,’ and thereby thinks it possible to change the word
‘communist,’ which in the real world means the follower of a definite revolutionary party, into a
mere category. Feuerbach’s whole deduction with regard to the relation of men to one another
goes only so far as to prove that men need and always have needed each other. He wants to
establish consciousness of this fact, that is to say, like the other theorists, merely to produce a
correct consciousness about an existing fact; whereas for the real communist it is a question of
overthrowing the existing state of things. We thoroughly appreciate, moreover, that Feuerbach,
in endeavouring to produce consciousness of just this fact, is going as far as a theorist possibly
can, without ceasing to be a theorist and philosopher...

As an example of Feuerbach’s acceptance and at the same time misunderstanding of existing
reality, which he still shares with our opponents, we recall the passage in the Philosophie der
Zukunft where he develops the view that the existence of a thing or a man is at the same time its
or his essence, that the conditions of existence, the mode of life and activity of an animal or
human individual are those in which its ‘essence’ feels itself satisfied. Here every exception is
expressly conceived as an unhappy chance, as an abnormality which cannot be altered. Thus if
millions of proletarians feel by no means contented with their living conditions, if their
‘existence’ does not in the least correspond to their ‘essence,’ then, according to the passage
quoted, this is an unavoidable misfortune, which must be borne quietly. The millions of
proletarians and communists, however, think differently and will prove this in time, when they
bring their ‘existence’ into harmony with their ‘essence’ in a practical way, by means of a
revolution. Feuerbach, therefore, never speaks of the world of man in such cases, but always
takes refuge in external nature, and moreover in nature which has not yet been subdued by men.
But every new invention, every advance made by industry, detaches another piece from this
domain, so that the ground which produces examples illustrating such Feuerbachian
propositions is steadily shrinking.


The ‘essence’ of the fish is its ‘being,’ water - to go no further than this one proposition. The
‘essence’ of the freshwater fish is the water of a river. But the latter ceases to be the ‘essence’ of
the fish and is no longer a suitable medium of existence as soon as the river is made to serve
industry, as soon as it is polluted by dyes and other waste products and navigated by steamboats,
or as soon as its water is diverted into canals where simple drainage can deprive the fish of its
medium of existence. The explanation that all such contradictions are inevitable abnormalities
does not essentially differ from the consolation which Saint Max Stirner offers to the
discontented, saving that this contradiction is their own contradiction and this predicament their
own predicament, whereupon then, should either set their minds at ease, keep their disgust to
themselves, or revolt against it in some fantastic way. It differs just as little from Saint Bruno’s
allegation that these unfortunate circumstances are due to the fact that those concerned are stuck
in the muck of ‘substance,’ have not advanced to ‘absolute self-consciousness and do not realise
that these adverse conditions are spirit of their spirit.

[II.]

[1. Preconditions of the Real Liberation of Man]

[...] We shall, of course, not take the trouble to enlighten our wise philosophers by explaining to
them that the ‘liberation’ of man is not advanced a single step by reducing philosophy, theology,
substance and all the trash to ‘self-consciousness’ and by liberating man from the domination of
these phrases, which have never held him in thrall. Nor will we explain to them that it is only
possible to achieve real liberation in the real world and by employing real means, that slavery
cannot be abolished without the steam-engine and the mule and spinning-jenny, serfdom cannot
be abolished without improved agriculture, and that, in general, people cannot be liberated as
long as they are unable to obtain food and drink, housing and clothing in adequate quality and
quantity. ‘Liberation’ is an historical and not a mental act, and it is brought about by historical
conditions, the development of industry, commerce, agriculture, the conditions of
intercourse...[There is here a gap in the manuscript]

In Germany, a country where only a trivial historical development is taking place, these mental
developments, these glorified and ineffective trivialities, naturally serve as a substitute for the
lack of historical development, and they take root and have to be combated. But this fight is of
local importance.

[2. Feuerbach’s Contemplative and Inconsistent Materialism]

In reality and for the practical materialist, i.e. the communist, it is a question of revolutionising
the existing world, of practically attacking and changing existing things. When occasionally we
find such views with Feuerbach, they are never more than isolated surmises and have much too
little influence on his general outlook to be considered here as anything else than embryos
capable of development. Feuerbach’s conception of the sensuous world is confined on the one
hand to mere contemplation of it, and on the other to mere feeling; he says ‘Man’ instead of
‘real historical man.’ ‘Man’ is really ‘the German.’ In the first case, the contemplation of the
sensuous world, he necessarily lights on things which contradict his consciousness and feeling,
which disturb the harmony he presupposes, the harmony of all parts of the sensuous world and
especially of man and nature. To remove this disturbance, he must take refuge in a double
perception, a profane one which only perceives the ‘flatly obvious’ and a higher, philosophical,
one which perceives the ‘true essence’ of things. He does not see how the sensuous world
around him is, not a thing given direct from all eternity, remaining ever the same, but the
product of industry and of the state of society; and, indeed, in the sense that it is an historical
product, the result of the activity of a whole succession of generations, each standing on the
shoulders of the preceding one, developing its industry and its intercourse, modifying its social
system according to the changed needs. Even the objects of the simplest ‘sensuous certainty’ are
only given him through social development, industry and commercial intercourse. The cherry-
tree, like almost all fruit-trees, was, as is well known, only a few centuries ago transplanted by
commerce into our zone, and therefore only by this action of a definite society in a definite age
it has become ‘sensuous certainty’ for Feuerbach.


Incidentally, when we conceive things thus, as they really are and happened, every profound
philosophical problem is resolved, as will be seen even more clearly later, quite simply into an
empirical fact. For instance, the important question of the relation of man to nature (Bruno
[Bauer] goes so far as to speak of ‘the antitheses in nature and history’ (p. 110), as though these
were two separate ‘things’ and man did not always have before him an historical nature and a
natural history) out of which all the ‘unfathomably lofty works’ on ‘substance’ and ‘self-
consciousness’ were born, crumbles of itself when we understand that the celebrated ‘unity of
man with nature’ has always existed in industry and has existed in varying forms in every epoch
according to the lesser or greater development of industry, just like the ‘struggle’ of man with
nature, right up to the development of his productive powers on a corresponding basis. Industry
and commerce, production and the exchange of the necessities of life, themselves determine
distribution, the structure of the different social classes and are, in turn, determined by it as to
the mode in which they are carried on; and so it happens that in Manchester, for instance,
Feuerbach sees only factories and machines, where a hundred years ago only spinning-wheels
and weaving-rooms were to be seen, or in the Campagna of Rome he finds only pasture lands
and swamps, where in the time of Augustus he would have found nothing but the vineyards and
villas of Roman capitalists. Feuerbach speaks in particular of the perception of natural science;
he mentions secrets which are disclosed only to the eye of the physicist and chemist; but where
would natural science be without industry and commerce? Even this pure natural science is
provided with an aim, as with its material, only through trade and industry, through the sensuous
activity of men. So much is this activity, this unceasing sensuous labour and creation, this
production, the basis of the whole sensuous world as it now exists, that, were it interrupted only
for a year, Feuerbach would not only find an enormous change in the natural world, but would
very soon find that the whole world of men and his own perceptive faculty, nay his own
existence, were missing. Of course, in all this the priority of external nature remains unassailed,
and all this has no application to the original men produced by generatio aequivoca
[spontaneous generation]; but this differentiation has meaning only insofar as man is considered
to be distinct from nature. For that matter, nature, the nature that preceded human history, is not
by any means the nature in which Feuerbach lives, it is nature which today no longer exists
anywhere (except perhaps on a few Australian coral-islands of recent origin) and which,
therefore, does not exist for Feuerbach.

Certainly Feuerbach has a great advantage over the ‘pure’ materialists in that he realises how
man too is an ‘object of the senses.’ But apart from the fact that he only conceives him as an
‘object of the senses, not as sensuous activity,’ because he still remains in the realm of theory
and conceives of men not in their given social connection, not under their existing conditions of
life, which have made them what they are, he never arrives at the really existing active men, but
stops at the abstraction ‘man,’ and gets no further than recognising ‘the true, individual,
corporeal man,’ emotionally, i.e. he knows no other ‘human relationships’ ‘of man to man’ than
love and friendship, and even then idealised. He gives no criticism of the present conditions of
life. Thus he never manages to conceive the sensuous world as the total living sensuous activity
of the individuals composing it; and therefore when, for example, he sees instead of healthy men
a crowd of scrofulous, overworked and consumptive starvelings, he is compelled to take refuge
in the ‘higher perception’ and in the ideal ‘compensation in the species,’ and thus to relapse into
idealism at the very point where the communist materialist sees the necessity, and at the same
time the condition, of a transformation both of industry and of the social structure.

As far as Feuerbach is a materialist he does not deal with history, and as far as he considers
history he is not a materialist. With him materialism and history diverge completely, a fact
which incidentally is already obvious from what has been said.

Ruling Class and Ruling Ideas

The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling
material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force. The class which has the
means of material production at its disposal, has control at the same time over the means of
mental production, so that thereby, generally speaking, the ideas of those who lack the means of
mental production are subject to it. The ruling ideas are nothing more than the ideal expression
of the dominant material relationships, the dominant material relationships grasped as ideas;


hence of the relationships which make the one class the ruling one, therefore, the ideas of its
dominance. The individuals composing the ruling class possess among other things
consciousness, and therefore think. Insofar, therefore, as they rule as a class and determine the
extent and compass of an epoch, it is self-evident that they do this in its whole range, hence
among other things rule also as thinkers, as producers of ideas, and regulate the production and
distribution of the ideas of their age: thus their ideas are the ruling ideas of the epoch. For
instance, in an age and in a country where royal power, aristocracy, and bourgeoisie are
contending for mastery and where, therefore, mastery is shared, the doctrine of the separation of
powers proves to be the dominant idea and is expressed as an ‘eternal law.’

The division of labour, which we already saw above as one of the chief forces of history up till
now, manifests itself also in the ruling class as the division of mental and material labour, so
that inside this class one part appears as the thinkers of the class (its active, conceptive
ideologists, who make the perfecting of the illusion of the class about itself their chief source of
livelihood), while the others’ attitude to these ideas and illusions is more passive and receptive,
because they are in reality the active members of this class and have less time to make up
illusions and ideas about themselves. Within this class this cleavage can even develop into a
certain opposition and hostility between the two parts, which, however, in the case of a practical
collision, in which the class itself is endangered, automatically comes to nothing, in which case
there also vanishes the semblance that the ruling ideas were not the ideas of the ruling class and
had a power distinct from the power of this class. The existence of revolutionary ideas in a
particular period presupposes the existence of a revolutionary class; about the premises for the
latter sufficient has already been said above.

If now in considering the course of history we detach the ideas of the ruling class from the
ruling class itself and attribute to them an independent existence, if we confine ourselves to
saying that these or those ideas were dominant at a given time, without bothering ourselves
about the conditions of production and the producers of these ideas, if we thus ignore the
individuals and world conditions which are the source of the ideas, we can say, for instance, that
during the time that the aristocracy was dominant, the concepts honour, loyalty, etc. were
dominant, during the dominance of the bourgeoisie the concepts freedom, equality, etc. The
ruling class itself on the whole imagines this to be so. This conception of history, which is
common to all historians, particularly since the eighteenth century, will necessarily come up
against the phenomenon that increasingly abstract ideas hold sway, i.e. ideas which increasingly
take on the form of universality. For each new class which puts itself in the place of one ruling
before it, is compelled, merely in order to carry through its aim, to represent its interest as the
common interest of all the members of society, that is, expressed in ideal form: it has to give its
ideas the form of universality, and represent them as the only rational, universally valid ones.
The class making a revolution appears from the very start, if only because it is opposed to a
class, not as a class but as the representative of the whole of society; it appears as the whole
mass of society confronting the one ruling class. ‘ -

Marginal note by Marx: Universality corresponds to (1) the class versus the estate, (2) the
competition, world-wide intercourse, etc., (3) the great numerical strength of the ruling class, (4)
the illusion of the common interests (in the beginning this illusion is true), (5) the delusion of
the ideologists and the division of labour.

- It can do this because, to start with, its interest really is more connected with the common
interest of all other non-ruling classes, because under the pressure of hitherto existing conditions
its interest has not yet been able to develop as the particular interest of a particular class. Its
victory, therefore, benefits also many individuals of the other classes which are not winning a
dominant position, but only insofar as it now puts these individuals in a position to raise
themselves into the ruling class. When the French bourgeoisie overthrew the power of the
aristocracy, it thereby made it possible for many proletarians to raise themselves above the
proletariat, but only insofar as they become bourgeois. Every new class, therefore, achieves its
hegemony only on a broader basis than that of the class ruling previously, whereas the
opposition of the non-ruling class against the new ruling class later develops all the more
sharply and profoundly. Both these things determine the fact that the struggle to be waged
against this new ruling class, in its turn, aims at a more decided and radical negation of the
previous conditions of society than could all previous classes which sought to rule.


This whole semblance, that the rule of a certain class is only the rule of certain ideas, comes to a
natural end, of course, as soon as class rule in general ceases to be the form in which society is
organised, that is to say, as soon as it is no longer necessary to represent a particular interest as
general or the ‘general interest’ as ruling.

Once the ruling ideas have been separated from the ruling individuals and, above all, from the
relationships which result from a given stage of the mode of production, and in this way the
conclusion has been reached that history is always under the sway of ideas, it is very easy to
abstract from these various ideas ‘the idea,’ the notion, etc. as the dominant force in history, and
thus to understand all these separate ideas and concepts as ‘forms of self-determination’ on the
part of the concept developing in history. It follows then naturally, too, that all the relationships
of men can be derived from the concept of man, man as conceived, the essence of man, Man.
This has been done by the speculative philosophers. Hegel himself confesses at the end of the
Geschichtsphilosophie that he ‘has considered the progress of the concept only’ and has
represented in history the ‘true theodicy.’ (p.446.) Now one can go back again to the producers
of the ‘concept,’ to the theorists, ideologists and philosophers, and one comes then to the
conclusion that the philosophers, the thinkers as such, have at all times been dominant in
history: a conclusion, as we see, already expressed by Hegel. The whole trick of proving the
hegemony of the spirit in history (hierarchy Stirner calls it) is thus confined to the following
three efforts.

No. 1. One must separate the ideas of those ruling for empirical reasons, under empirical
conditions and as empirical individuals, from these actual rulers, and thus recognise the rule of
ideas or illusions in history.

No. 2. One must bring an order into this rule of ideas, prove a mystical connection among the
successive ruling ideas, which is managed by understanding them as ‘acts of self-determination
on the part of the concept’ (this is possible because by virtue of their empirical basis these ideas
are really connected with one another and because, conceived as mere ideas, they become self-
distinctions, distinctions made by thought).

No. 3. To remove the mystical appearance of this ‘self-determining concept’ it is changed into a
person - ‘Self-Consciousness’ - or, to appear thoroughly materialistic, into a series of persons,
who represent the ‘concept’ in history, into the ‘thinkers,’ the ‘philosophers,’ the ideologists,
who again are understood as the manufacturers of history, as the ‘council of guardians,’ as the
rulers. Thus the whole body of materialistic elements has been removed from history and now
full rein can be given to the speculative steed.

Whilst in ordinary life every shopkeeper is very well able to distinguish between what
somebody professes to be and what he really is, our historians have not yet won even this trivial
insight. They take every epoch at its word and believe that everything it says and imagines about
itself is true.

This historical method which reigned in Germany, and especially the reason why, must be
understood from its connection with the illusion of ideologists in general, e.g. the illusions of
the jurist, politicians (of the practical statesmen among them, too), from the dogmatic dreamings
and distortions of these fellows; this is explained perfectly easily from their practical position in
life, their job, and the division of labour.
