### D. Proletarians and Communism

Individuals, Class, and Community

In the Middle Ages the citizens in each town were compelled to unite against the landed nobility
to save their skins. The extension of trade, the establishment of communications, led the
separate towns to get to know other towns, which had asserted the same interests in the struggle
with the same antagonist. Out of the many local corporations of burghers there arose only
gradually the burgher class. The conditions of life of the individual burghers became, on
account of their contradiction to the existing relationships and of the mode of labour determined
by these, conditions which were common to them all and independent of each individual. The
burghers had created the conditions insofar as they had torn themselves free from feudal ties,
and were created by them insofar as they were determined by their antagonism to the feudal
system which they found in existence. When the individual towns began to enter into
associations, these common conditions developed into class conditions. The same conditions,
the same contradiction, the same interests necessarily called forth on the whole similar customs
everywhere. The bourgeoisie itself with its conditions, develops only gradually, splits according
to the division of labour into various fractions and finally absorbs all propertied classes it finds
in existence [Marginal note by Marx: To begin with it absorbs the branches of labour directly
belonging to the State and then all ±[more or less] ideological estates]. (while it develops the
majority of the earlier propertyless and a part of the hitherto propertied classes into a new class,
the proletariat) in the measure to which all property found in existence is transformed into
industrial or commercial capital. The separate individuals form a class only insofar as they have
to carry on a common battle against another class; otherwise they are on hostile terms with each
other as competitors. On the other hand, the class in its turn achieves an independent existence


over against the individuals, so that the latter find their conditions of existence predestined, and
hence have their position in life and their personal development assigned to them by their class,
become subsumed under it. This is the same phenomenon as the subjection of the separate
individuals to the division of labour and can only be removed by the abolition of private
property and of labour itself. We have already indicated several times how this subsuming of
individuals under the class brings with it their subjection to all kinds of ideas, etc.

If from a philosophical point of view one considers this evolution of individuals in the common
conditions of existence of estates and classes, which followed on one another, and in the
accompanying general conceptions forced upon them, it is certainly very easy to imagine that in
these individuals the species, or ‘Man’, has evolved, or that they evolved ‘Man’ - and in this
way one can give history some hard clouts on the ear. [Marginal note by Marx to this sentence:
With the philosophers pre-existence of the class]. One can conceive these various estates and
classes to be specific terms of the general expression, subordinate varieties of the species, or
evolutionary phases of ‘Man’.

This subsuming of individuals under definite classes cannot be abolished until a class has taken
shape, which has no longer any particular class interest to assert against the ruling class.

The transformation, through the division of labour, of personal powers (relationships) into
material powers, cannot be dispelled by dismissing the general idea of it from one's mind, but
can only be abolished by the individuals again subjecting these material powers to themselves
and abolishing the division of labour. This is not possible without the community. Only in
community [with others has each] individual the means of cultivating his gifts in all directions;
only in the community, therefore, is personal freedom possible. In the previous substitutes for
the community, in the State, etc. personal freedom has existed only for the individuals who
developed within the relationships of the ruling class, and only insofar as they were individuals
of this class. The illusory community, in which individuals have up till now combined, always
took on an independent existence in relation to them, and was at the same time, since it was the
combination of one class over against another, not only a completely illusory community, but a
new fetter as well. In a real community the individuals obtain their freedom in and through their
association.

Individuals have always built on themselves, but naturally on themselves within their given
historical conditions and relationships, not on the ‘pure’ individual in the sense of the
ideologists. But in the course of historical evolution, and precisely through the inevitable fact
that within the division of labour social relationships take on an independent existence, there
appears a division within the life of each individual, insofar as it is personal and insofar as it is
determined by some branch of labour and the conditions pertaining to it. (We do not mean it to
be understood from this that, for example, the rentier, the capitalist, etc. cease to be persons; but
their personality is conditioned and determined by quite definite class relationships, and the
division appears only in their opposition to another class and, for themselves, only when they go
bankrupt.) In the estate (and even more in the tribe) this is as yet concealed: for instance, a
nobleman always remains a nobleman, a commoner always a commoner, apart from his other
relationships, a quality inseparable from his individuality. The division between the personal
and the class individual, the accidental nature of the conditions of life for the individual, appears
only with the emergence of the class, which is itself a product of the bourgeoisie. This
accidental character is only engendered and developed by competition and the struggle of
individuals among themselves. Thus, in imagination, individuals seem freer under the
dominance of the bourgeoisie than before, because their conditions of life seem accidental; in
reality, of course, they are less free, because they are more subjected to the violence of things.
The difference from the estate comes out particularly in the antagonism between the bourgeoisie
and the proletariat. When the estate of the urban burghers, the corporations, etc. emerged in
opposition to the landed nobility, their condition of existence - movable property and craft
labour, which had already existed latently before their separation from the feudal ties - appeared
as something positive, which was asserted against feudal landed property, and, therefore, in its
own way at first took on a feudal form. Certainly the refugee serfs treated their previous
servitude as something accidental to their personality. But here they only were doing what every
class that is freeing itself from a fetter does; and they did not free themselves as a class but
separately. Moreover, they did not rise above the system of estates, but only formed a new


estate, retaining their previous mode of labour even in their new situation, and developing it
further by freeing it from its earlier fetters, which no longer corresponded to the development
already attained.

N.B. - It must not be forgotten that the serf's very need of existing and the impossibility of a
large-scale economy, which involved the distribution of the allotments among the serfs, very
soon reduced the services of the serfs to their lord to an average of payments in kind and statute-
labour. This made it possible for the serf to accumulate movable property and hence facilitated
his escape out of the possession of his lord and gave him the prospect of making his way as an
urban citizen; it also created gradations among the serfs, so that the runaway serfs were already
half burghers. It is likewise obvious that the serfs who were masters of a craft had the best
chance of acquiring movable property.

[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01d.htm](http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01d.htm) - 3#3For the
proletarians, on the other hand, the condition of their existence, labour, and with it all the
conditions of existence governing modern society, have become something accidental,
something over which they, as separate individuals, have no control, and over which no social
organisation can give them control. The contradiction between the individuality of each separate
proletarian and labour, the condition of life forced upon him, becomes evident to him himself,
for he is sacrificed from youth upwards and, within his own class, has no chance of arriving at
the conditions which would place him in the other class.

Thus, while the refugee serfs only wished to be free to develop and assert those conditions of
existence which were already there, and hence, in the end, only arrived at free labour, the
proletarians, if they are to assert themselves as individuals, will have to abolish the very
condition of their existence hitherto (which has, moreover, been that of all society up to the
present), namely, labour. Thus they find themselves directly opposed to the form in which,
hitherto, the individuals, of which society consists, have given themselves collective expression,
that is, the State. In order, therefore, to assert themselves as individuals, they must overthrow
the State.

It follows from all we have been saying up till now that the communal relationship into which
the individuals of a class entered, and which was determined by their common interests over
against a third party, was always a community to which these individuals belonged only as
average individuals, only insofar as they lived within the conditions of existence of their class -
a relationship in which they participated not as individuals but as members of a class. With the
community of revolutionary proletarians, on the other hand, who take their conditions of
existence and those of all members of society under their control, it is just the reverse; it is as
individuals that the individuals participate in it. It is just this combination of individuals
(assuming the advanced stage of modern productive forces, of course) which puts the conditions
of the free development and movement of individuals under their control - conditions which
were previously abandoned to chance and had won an independent existence over against the
separate individuals just because of their separation as individuals, and because of the necessity
of their combination which had been determined by the division of labour, and through their
separation had become a bond alien to them. Combination up till now (by no means an arbitrary
one, such as is expounded for example in the Contrat social, but a necessary one) was an
agreement upon these conditions, within which the individuals were free to enjoy the freaks of
fortune (compare, e.g., the formation of the North American State and the South American
republics). This right to the undisturbed enjoyment, within certain conditions, of fortuity and
chance has up till now been called personal freedom. These conditions of existence are, of
course, only the productive forces and forms of intercourse at any particular time.

Forms of Intercourse

Communism differs from all previous movements in that it overturns the basis of all earlier
relations of production and intercourse, and for the first time consciously treats all natural
premises as the creatures of hitherto existing men, strips them of their natural character and
subjugates them to the power of the united individuals. Its organisation is, therefore, essentially
economic, the material production of the conditions of this unity; it turns existing conditions
into conditions of unity. The reality, which communism is creating, is precisely the true basis
for rendering it impossible that anything should exist independently of individuals, insofar as


reality is only a product of the preceding intercourse of individuals themselves. Thus the
communists in practice treat the conditions created up to now by production and intercourse as
inorganic conditions, without, however, imagining that it was the plan or the destiny of previous
generations to give them material, and without believing that these conditions were inorganic
for the individuals creating them.

```
Contradiction between individuals and their conditions of life as
contradiction between productive forces and the form of intercourse
```
The difference between the individual as a person and what is accidental to him, is not a
conceptual difference but an historical fact. This distinction has a different significance at
different times - e.g. the estate as something accidental to the individual in the eighteenth
century, the family more or less too. It is not a distinction that we have to make for each age, but
one which each age makes itself from among the different elements which it finds in existence,
and indeed not according to any theory, but compelled by material collisions in life.

What appears accidental to the later age as opposed to the earlier - and this applies also to the
elements handed down by an earlier age - is a form of intercourse which corresponded to a
definite stage of development of the productive forces. The relation of the productive forces to
the form of intercourse is the relation of the form of intercourse to the occupation or activity of
the individuals. (The fundamental form of this activity is, of course, material, on which depend
all other forms - mental, political, religious, etc. The various shaping of material life is, of
course, in every case dependent on the needs which are already developed, and the production,
as well as the satisfaction, of these needs is an historical process, which is not found in the case
of a sheep or a dog (Stirner's refractory principal argument adversus hominem), although sheep
and dogs in their present form certainly, but malgré eux, are products of an historical process.)
The conditions under which individuals have intercourse with each other, so long as the above-
mentioned contradiction is absent, are conditions appertaining to their individuality, in no way
external to them; conditions under which these definite individuals, living under definite
relationships, can alone produce their material life and what is connected with it, are thus the
conditions of their self-activity and are produced by this self-activity. The definite condition
under which they produce, thus corresponds, as long as the contradiction has not yet appeared,
to the reality of their conditioned nature, their one-sided existence, the one-sidedness of which
only becomes evident when the contradiction enters on the scene and thus exists for the later
individuals. Then this condition appears as an accidental fetter, and the consciousness that it is a
fetter is imputed to the earlier age as well.

These various conditions, which appear first as conditions of self-activity, later as fetters upon
it, form in the whole evolution of history a coherent series of forms of intercourse, the
coherence of which consists in this: in the place of an earlier form of intercourse, which has
become a fetter, a new one is put, corresponding to the more developed productive forces and,
hence, to the advanced mode of the self-activity of individuals - a form which in its turn
becomes a fetter and is then replaced by another. Since these conditions correspond at every
stage to the simultaneous development of the productive forces, their history is at the same time
the history of the evolving productive forces taken over by each new generation, and is,
therefore, the history of the development of the forces of the individuals themselves.

Since this evolution takes place naturally, i.e. is not subordinated to a general plan of freely
combined individuals, it proceeds from various localities, tribes, nations, branches of labour,
etc. each of which to start with develops independently of the others and only gradually enters
into relation with the others. Furthermore, it takes place only very slowly; the various stages and
interests are never completely overcome, but only subordinated to the prevailing interest and
trail along beside the latter for centuries afterwards. It follows from this that within a nation
itself the individuals, even apart from their pecuniary circumstances, have quite different
developments, and that an earlier interest, the peculiar form of intercourse of which has already
been ousted by that belonging to a later interest, remains for a long time afterwards in
possession of a traditional power in the illusory community (State, law), which has won an
existence independent of the individuals; a power which in the last resort can only be broken by
a revolution. This explains why, with reference to individual points which allow of a more
general summing-up, consciousness can sometimes appear further advanced than the


contemporary empirical relationships, so that in the struggles of a later epoch one can refer to
earlier theoreticians as authorities.

On the other hand, in countries which, like North America, begin in an already advanced
historical epoch, the development proceeds very rapidly. Such countries have no other natural
premises than the individuals, who settled there and were led to do so because the forms of
intercourse of the old countries did not correspond to their wants. Thus they begin with the most
advanced individuals of the old countries, and, therefore, with the correspondingly most
advanced form of intercourse, before this form of intercourse has been able to establish itself in
the old countries. This is the case with all colonies, insofar as they are not mere military or
trading stations. Carthage, the Greek colonies, and Iceland in the eleventh and twelfth centuries,
provide examples of this. A similar relationship issues from conquest, when a form of
intercourse which has evolved on another soil is brought over complete to the conquered
country: whereas in its home it was still encumbered with interests and relationships left over
from earlier periods, here it can and must be established completely and without hindrance, if
only to assure the conquerors' lasting power. (England and Naples after the Norman conquest,
when they received the most perfect form of feudal organisation.)

```
[5. The Contradiction Between the Productive Forces and the Form of
Intercourse as the Basis for Social Revolution]
```
This contradiction between the productive forces and the form of intercourse, which, as we saw,
has occurred several times in past history, without, however, endangering the basis, necessarily
on each occasion burst out in a revolution, taking on at the same time various subsidiary forms,
such as all-embracing collisions, collisions of various classes, contradiction of consciousness,
battle of ideas, etc., political conflict, etc. From a narrow point of view one may isolate one of
these subsidiary forms and consider it as the basis of these revolutions; and this is all the more
easy as the individuals who started the revolutions had illusions about their own activity
according to their degree of culture and the stage of historical development.

Thus all collisions in history have their origin, according to our view, in the contradiction
between the productive forces and the form of intercourse. Incidentally, to lead to collisions in a
country, this contradiction need not necessarily have reached its extreme limit in this particular
country. The competition with industrially more advanced countries, brought about by the
expansion of international intercourse, is sufficient to produce a similar contradiction in
countries with a backward industry (e.g. the latent proletariat in Germany brought into view by
view by the competition of English industry).

Conquest

This whole interpretation of history appears to be contradicted by the fact of conquest. Up till
now violence, war, pillage, murder and robbery, etc. have been accepted as the driving force of
history. Here we must limit ourselves to the chief points and take, therefore, only the most
striking example - the destruction of an old civilisation by a barbarous people and the resulting
formation of an entirely new organisation of society. (Rome and the barbarians; feudalism and
Gaul; the Byzantine Empire and the Turks.)

With the conquering barbarian people war itself is still, as indicated above, a regular form of
intercourse, which is the more eagerly exploited as the increase in population together with the
traditional and, for it, the only possible, crude mode of production gives rise to the need for new
means of production. In Italy, on the other hand, the concentration of landed property (caused
not only by buying-up and indebtedness but also by inheritance, since loose living being rife and
marriage rare, the old families gradually died out and their possessions fell into the hands of a
few) and its conversion into grazing land (caused not only by the usual economic forces still
operative today but by the importation of plundered and tribute-corn and the resultant lack of
demand for Italian corn) brought about the almost total disappearance of the free population.
The very slaves died out again and again, and had constantly to be replaced by new ones.
Slavery remained the basis of the whole productive system. The plebeians, midway between
freemen and slaves, never succeeded in becoming more than a proletarian rabble. Rome indeed


never became more than a city; its connection with the provinces was almost exclusively
political and could, therefore, easily be broken again by political events.

Nothing is more common than the notion that in history up till now it has only been a question
of taking. The barbarians take the Roman Empire, and this fact of taking is made to explain the
transition from the old world to the feudal system. In this taking by barbarians, however, the
question is, whether the nation which is conquered has evolved industrial productive forces, as
is the case with modern peoples, or whether their productive forces are based for the most part
merely on their association and on the community. Taking is further determined by the object
taken. A banker's fortune, consisting of paper, cannot be taken at all, without the taker's
submitting to the conditions of production and intercourse of the country taken. Similarly the
total industrial capital of a modern industrial country. And finally, everywhere there is very
soon an end to taking, and when there is nothing more to take, you have to set about producing.
From this necessity of producing, which very soon asserts itself, it follows that the form of
community adopted by the settling conquerors must correspond to the stage of development of
the productive forces they find in existence; or, if this is not the case from the start, it must
change according to the productive forces. By this, too, is explained the fact, which people
profess to have noticed everywhere in the period following the migration of the peoples,
namely, that the servant was master, and that the conquerors very soon took over language,
culture and manners from the conquered. The feudal system was by no means brought complete
from Germany, but had its origin, as far as the conquerors were concerned, in the martial
organisation of the army during the actual conquest, and this only evolved after the conquest
into the feudal system proper through the action of the productive forces found in the conquered
countries. To what an extent this form was determined by the productive forces is shown by the
abortive attempts to realise other forms derived from reminiscences of ancient Rome
(Charlemagne, etc.).

Contradictions of Big Industry: Revolution

Our investigation hitherto started from the instruments of production, and it has already shown
that private property was a necessity for certain industrial stages. In industrie extractive private
property still coincides with labour; in small industry and all agriculture up till now property is
the necessary consequence of the existing instruments of production; in big industry the
contradiction between the instrument of production and private property appears from the first
time and is the product of big industry; moreover, big industry must be highly developed to
produce this contradiction. And thus only with big industry does the abolition of private
property become possible.

```
[9. Contradiction Between the Productive Forces and the Form of
Intercourse]
```
In big industry and competition the whole mass of conditions of existence, limitations, biases of
individuals, are fused together into the two simplest forms: private property and labour. With
money every form of intercourse, and intercourse itself, is considered fortuitous for the
individuals. Thus money implies that all previous intercourse was only intercourse of
individuals under particular conditions, not of individuals as individuals. These conditions are
reduced to two: accumulated labour or private property, and actual labour. If both or one of
these ceases, then intercourse comes to a standstill. The modern economists themselves, e.g.
Sismondi, Cherbuliez, etc., oppose ‘association of individuals’ to ‘association of capital.’ On the
other hand, the individuals themselves are entirely subordinated to the division of labour and
hence are brought into the most complete dependence on one another. Private property, insofar
as within labour itself it is opposed to labour, evolves out of the necessity of accumulation, and
has still, to begin with, rather the form of the communality; but in its further development it
approaches more and more the modern form of private property. The division of labour implies
from the outset the division of the conditions of labour, of tools and materials, and thus the
splitting-up of accumulated capital among different owners, and thus, also, the division between
capital and labour, and the different forms of property itself. The more the division of labour
develops and accumulation grows, the sharper are the forms that this process of differentiation
assumes. Labour itself can only exist on the premise of this fragmentation.


Thus two facts are here revealed. First the productive forces appear as a world for themselves,
quite independent of and divorced from the individuals, alongside the individuals: the reason for
this is that the individuals, whose forces they are, exist split up and in opposition to one another,
whilst, on the other hand, these forces are only real forces in the intercourse and association of
these individuals. Thus, on the one hand, we have a totality of productive forces, which have, as
it were, taken on a material form and are for the individuals no longer the forces of the
individuals but of private property, and hence of the individuals only insofar as they are owners
of private property themselves. Never, in any earlier period, have the productive forces taken on
a form so indifferent to the intercourse of individuals as individuals, because their intercourse
itself was formerly a restricted one. On the other hand, standing over against these productive
forces, we have the majority of the individuals from whom these forces have been wrested
away, and who, robbed thus of all real life-content, have become abstract individuals, but who
are, however, only by this fact put into a position to enter into relation with one another as
individuals.

The only connection which still links them with the productive forces and with their own
existence - labour - has lost all semblance of self-activity and only sustains their life by stunting
it. While in the earlier periods self-activity and the production of material life were separated, in
that they devolved on different persons, and while, on account of the narrowness of the
individuals themselves, the production of material life was considered as a subordinate mode of
self-activity, they now diverge to such an extent that altogether material life appears as the end,
and what produces this material life, labour (which is now the only possible but, as we see,
negative form of self-activity), as the means.

[10. The Necessity, Preconditions and Consequences of the Abolition of

Private Property]

Thus things have now come to such a pass that the individuals must appropriate the existing
totality of productive forces, not only to achieve self-activity, but, also, merely to safeguard
their very existence. This appropriation is first determined by the object to be appropriated, the
productive forces, which have been developed to a totality and which only exist within a
universal intercourse. From this aspect alone, therefore, this appropriation must have a universal
character corresponding to the productive forces and the intercourse.

The appropriation of these forces is itself nothing more than the development of the individual
capacities corresponding to the material instruments of production. The appropriation of a
totality of instruments of production is, for this very reason, the development of a totality of
capacities in the individuals themselves.

This appropriation is further determined by the persons appropriating. Only the proletarians of
the present day, who are completely shut off from all self-activity, are in a position to achieve a
complete and no longer restricted self-activity, which consists in the appropriation of a totality
of productive forces and in the thus postulated development of a totality of capacities. All earlier
revolutionary appropriations were restricted; individuals, whose self-activity was restricted by a
crude instrument of production and a limited intercourse, appropriated this crude instrument of
production, and hence merely achieved a new state of limitation. Their instrument of production
became their property, but they themselves remained subordinate to the division of labour and
their own instrument of production. In all expropriations up to now, a mass of individuals
remained subservient to a single instrument of production; in the appropriation by the
proletarians, a mass of instruments of production must be made subject to each individual, and
property to all. Modern universal intercourse can be controlled by individuals, therefore, only
when controlled by all.

This appropriation is further determined by the manner in which it must be effected. It can only
be effected through a union, which by the character of the proletariat itself can again only be a
universal one, and through a revolution, in which, on the one hand, the power of the earlier
mode of production and intercourse and social organisation is overthrown, and, on the other
hand, there develops the universal character and the energy of the proletariat, without which the
revolution cannot be accomplished; and in which, further, the proletariat rids itself of everything
that still clings to it from its previous position in society.


Only at this stage does self-activity coincide with material life, which corresponds to the
development of individuals into complete individuals and the casting-off of all natural
limitations. The transformation of labour into self-activity corresponds to the transformation of
the earlier limited intercourse into the intercourse of individuals as such. With the appropriation
of the total productive forces through united individuals, private property comes to an end.
Whilst previously in history a particular condition always appeared as accidental, now the
isolation of individuals and the particular private gain of each man have themselves become
accidental.

The individuals, who are no longer subject to the division of labour, have been conceived by the
philosophers as an ideal, under the name ‘Man’. They have conceived the whole process which
we have outlined as the evolutionary process of ‘Man,’ so that at every historical stage ‘Man’
was substituted for the individuals and shown as the motive force of history. The whole process
was thus conceived as a process of the self-estrangement of ‘Man,’ and this was essentially due
to the fact that the average individual of the later stage was always foisted on to the earlier stage,
and the consciousness of a later age on to the individuals of an earlier. Through this inversion,
which from the first is an abstract image of the actual conditions, it was possible to transform
the whole of history into an evolutionary process of consciousness.

The Necessity of the Communist Revolution

Finally, from the conception of history we have sketched we obtain these further conclusions:

(1) In the development of productive forces there comes a stage when productive forces and
means of intercourse are brought into being, which, under the existing relationships, only cause
mischief, and are no longer productive but destructive forces (machinery and money); and
connected with this a class is called forth, which has to bear all the burdens of society without
enjoying its advantages, which, ousted from society, is forced into the most decided antagonism
to all other classes; a class which forms the majority of all members of society, and from which
emanates the consciousness of the necessity of a fundamental revolution, the communist
consciousness, which may, of course, arise among the other classes too through the
contemplation of the situation of this class.

(2) The conditions under which definite productive forces can be applied are the conditions of
the rule of a definite class of society, whose social power, deriving from its property, has its
practical-idealistic expression in each case in the form of the State; and, therefore, every
revolutionary struggle is directed against a class, which till then has been in power. [Marginal
note by Marx:] The people are interested in maintaining the present state of
production.http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01d.htm -
4#4

(3) In all revolutions up till now the mode of activity always remained unscathed and it was only
a question of a different distribution of this activity, a new distribution of labour to other
persons, whilst the communist revolution is directed against the preceding mode of activity,
does away with labour, and abolishes the rule of all classes with the classes themselves, because
it is carried through by the class which no longer counts as a class in society, is not recognised
as a class, and is in itself the expression of the dissolution of all classes, nationalities, etc. within
present society; and

(4) Both for the production on a mass scale of this communist consciousness, and for the
success of the cause itself, the alteration of men on a mass scale is, necessary, an alteration
which can only take place in a practical movement, a revolution; this revolution is necessary,
therefore, not only because the ruling class cannot be overthrown in any other way, but also
because the class overthrowing it can only in a revolution succeed in ridding itself of all the
muck of ages and become fitted to found society anew.
