### C. The Real Basis of Ideology

Division of Labour: Town and Country

[Four pages of the manuscript are missing

From the first there follows the premise of a highly developed division of labour and an
extensive commerce; from the second, the locality. In the first case the individuals must be
brought together; in the second they find themselves alongside the given instrument of
production as instruments of production themselves. Here, therefore, arises the difference
between natural instruments of production and those created by civilisation. The field (water,
etc.) can be regarded as a natural instrument of production. In the first case, that of the natural
instrument of production, individuals are subservient to nature; in the second, to a product of


labour. In the first case, therefore, property (landed property) appears as direct natural
domination, in the second, as domination of labour, particularly of accumulated labour, capital.
The first case presupposes that the individuals are united by some bond: family, tribe, the land
itself, etc.; the second, that they are independent of one another and are only held together by
exchange. In the first case, what is involved is chiefly an exchange between men and nature in
which the labour of the former is exchanged for the products of the latter; in the second, it is
predominantly an exchange of men among themselves. In the first case, average, human
common sense is adequate - physical activity is as yet not separated from mental activity; in the
second, the division between physical and mental labour must already be practically completed.
In the first case, the domination of the proprietor over the propertyless may be based on a
personal relationship, on a kind of community; in the second, it must have taken on a material
shape in a third party - money. In the first case, small industry exists, but determined by the
utilisation of the natural instrument of production and therefore without the distribution of
labour among various individuals; in the second, industry exists only in and through the division
of labour.

```
[2. The Division of Material and Mental Labour.
Separation of Town and Country, The Guild System]
```
The greatest division of material and mental labour is the separation of town and country. The
antagonism between town and country begins with the transition from barbarism to civilisation,
from tribe to State, from locality to nation, and runs through the whole history of civilisation to
the present day (the Anti-Corn Law League).

The existence of the town implies, at the same time, the necessity of administration, police,
taxes, etc.; in short, of the municipality, and thus of politics in general. Here first became
manifest the division of the population into two great classes, which is directly based on the
division of labour and on the instruments of production. The town already is in actual fact the
concentration of the population, of the instruments of production, of capital, of pleasures, of
needs, while the country demonstrates just the opposite fact, isolation and separation. The
antagonism between town and country can only exist within the framework of private property.
It is the most crass expression of the subjection of the individual under the division of labour,
under a definite activity forced upon him - a subjection which makes one man into a restricted
town-animal, the other into a restricted country-animal, and daily creates anew the conflict
between their interests. Labour is here again the chief thing, power over individuals, and as long
as the latter exists, private property must exist. The abolition of the antagonism between town
and country is one of the first conditions of communal life, a condition which again depends on
a mass of material premises and which cannot be fulfilled by the mere will, as anyone can see at
the first glance. (These conditions have still to be enumerated.) The separation of town and
country can also be understood as the separation of capital and landed property, as the beginning
of the existence and development of capital independent of landed property - the beginning of
property having its basis only in labour and exchange.

In the towns which, in the Middle Ages, did not derive ready-made from an earlier period but
were formed anew by the serfs who had become free, each man's own particular labour was his
only property apart from the small capital he brought with him, consisting almost solely of the
most necessary tools of his craft. The competition of serfs constantly escaping into the town, the
constant war of the country against the towns and thus the necessity of an organised municipal
military force, the bond of common ownership in a particular kind of labour, the necessity of
common buildings for the sale of their wares at a time when craftsmen were also traders, and the
consequent exclusion of the unauthorised from these buildings, the conflict among the interests
of the various crafts, the necessity of protecting their laboriously acquired skill, and the feudal
organisation of the whole of the country: these were the causes of the union of the workers of
each craft in guilds. We have not at this point to go further into the manifold modifications of
the guild-system, which arise through later historical developments. The flight of the serfs into
the towns went on without interruption right through the Middle Ages. These serfs, persecuted
by their lords in the country, came separately into the towns, where they found an organised
community, against which they were powerless and in which they had to subject themselves to
the station assigned to them by the demand for their labour and the interest of their organised


urban competitors. These workers, entering separately, were never able to attain to any power,
since, if their labour was of the guild type which had to be learned, the guild-masters bent them
to their will and organised them according to their interest; or if their labour was not such as had
to be learned, and therefore not of the guild type, they became day-labourers and never managed
to organise, remaining an unorganised rabble. The need for day-labourers in the towns created
the rabble.

These towns were true ‘associations’, called forth by the direct need, the care of providing for
the protection of property, and of multiplying the means of production and defence of the
separate members. The rabble of these towns was devoid of any power, composed as it was of
individuals strange to one another who had entered separately, and who stood unorganised over
against an organised power, armed for war, and jealously watching over them. The journeymen
and apprentices were organised in each craft as it best suited the interest of the masters. The
patriarchal relationship existing between them and their masters gave the latter a double power -
on the one hand because of their influence on the whole life of the journeymen, and on the other
because, for the journeymen who worked with the same master, it was a real bond which held
them together against the journeymen of other masters and separated them from these. And
finally, the journeymen were bound to the existing order by their simple interest in becoming
masters themselves. While, therefore, the rabble at least carried out revolts against the whole
municipal order, revolts which remained completely ineffective because of their powerlessness,
the journeymen never got further than small acts of insubordination within separate guilds, such
as belong to the very nature of the guild-system. The great risings of the Middle Ages all
radiated from the country, but equally remained totally ineffective because of the isolation and
consequent crudity of the peasants.

In the towns, the division of labour between the individual guilds was as yet [quite naturally
derived] and, in the guilds themselves, not at all developed between the individual workers.
Every workman had to be versed in a whole round of tasks, had to be able to make everything
that was to be made with his tools. The limited commerce and the scanty communication
between the individual towns, the lack of population and the narrow needs did not allow of a
higher division of labour, and therefore every man who wished to become a master had to be
proficient in the whole of his craft. Thus there is found with medieval craftsmen an interest in
their special work and in proficiency in it, which was capable of rising to a narrow artistic sense.
For this very reason, however, every medieval craftsman was completely absorbed in his work,
to which he had a contented, slavish relationship, and to which he was subjected to a far greater
extent than the modern worker, whose work is a matter of indifference to him.

Capital in these towns was a naturally derived capital, consisting of a house, the tools of the
craft, and the natural, hereditary customers; and not being realisable, on account of the
backwardness of commerce and the lack of circulation, it descended from father to son. Unlike
modern capital, which can be assessed in money and which may be indifferently invested in this
thing or that, this capital was directly connected with the particular work of the owner,
inseparable from it and to this extent estate capital.

Further Division of Labour

The next extension of the division of labour was the separation of production and commerce, the
formation of a special class of merchants; a separation which, in the towns bequeathed by a
former period, had been handed down (among other things with the Jews) and which very soon
appeared in the newly formed ones. With this there was given the possibility of commercial
communications transcending the immediate neighbourhood, a possibility, the realisation of
which depended on the existing means of communication, the state of public safety in the
countryside, which was determined by political conditions (during the whole of the Middle
Ages, as is well known, the merchants travelled in armed caravans), and on the cruder or more
advanced needs (determined by the stage of culture attained) of the region accessible to
intercourse.

With commerce the prerogative of a particular class, with the extension of trade through the
merchants beyond the immediate surroundings of the town, there immediately appears a
reciprocal action between production and commerce. The towns enter into relations with one
another, new tools are brought from one town into the other, and the separation between


production and commerce soon calls forth a new division of production between the individual
towns, each of which is soon exploiting a predominant branch of industry. The local restrictions
of earlier times begin gradually to be broken down.

It depends purely on the extension of commerce whether the productive forces achieved in a
locality, especially inventions, are lost for later development or not. As long as there exists no
commerce transcending the immediate neighbourhood, every invention must be made separately
in each locality, and mere chances such as irruptions of barbaric peoples, even ordinary wars,
are sufficient to cause a country with advanced productive forces and needs to have to start right
over again from the beginning. In primitive history every invention had to be made daily anew
and in each locality independently. How little highly developed productive forces are safe from
complete destruction, given even a relatively very extensive commerce, is proved by the
Phoenicians, whose inventions were for the most part lost for a long time to come through the
ousting of this nation from commerce, its conquest by Alexander and its consequent decline.
Likewise, for instance, glass-painting in the Middle Ages. Only when commerce has become
world commerce and has as its basis large-scale industry, when all nations are drawn into the
competitive struggle, is the permanence of the acquired productive forces assured.

The Rise of Manufacturing

The immediate consequence of the division of labour between the various towns was the rise of
manufactures, branches of production which had outgrown the guild-system. Manufactures first
flourished, in Italy and later in Flanders, under the historical premise of commerce with foreign
nations. In other countries, England and France for example, manufactures were at first confined
to the home market. Besides the premises already mentioned manufactures depend on an
already advanced concentration of population, particularly in the countryside, and of capital,
which began to accumulate in the hands of individuals, partly in the guilds in spite of the guild
regulations, partly among the merchants.

That labour which from the first presupposed a machine, even of the crudest sort, soon showed
itself the most capable of development. Weaving, earlier carried on in the country by the
peasants as a secondary occupation to procure their clothing, was the first labour to receive an
impetus and a further development through the extension of commerce. Weaving was the first
and remained the principal manufacture. The rising demand for clothing materials, consequent
on the growth of population, the growing accumulation and mobilisation of natural capital
through accelerated circulation, the demand for luxuries called forth by the latter and favoured
generally by the gradual extension of commerce, gave weaving a quantitative and qualitative
stimulus, which wrenched it out of the form of production hitherto existing. Alongside the
peasants weaving for their own use, who continued, and still continue, with this sort of work,
there emerged a new class of weavers in the towns, whose fabrics were destined for the whole
home market and usually for foreign markets too.

Weaving, an occupation demanding in most cases little skill and soon splitting up into countless
branches, by its whole nature resisted the trammels of the guild. Weaving was, therefore, carried
on mostly in villages and market-centres without guild organisation, which gradually became
towns, and indeed the most flourishing towns in each land.

With guild-free manufacture, property relations also quickly changed. The first advance beyond
naturally derived estate capital was provided by the rise of merchants whose capital was from
the beginning movable, capital in the modern sense as far as one can speak of it, given the
circumstances of those times. The second advance came with manufacture, which again made
mobile a mass of natural capital, and altogether increased the mass of movable capital as against
that of natural capital.

At the same time, manufacture became a refuge of the peasants from the guilds which excluded
them or paid them badly, just as earlier the guild-towns had [served] as a refuge for the peasants
from [the oppressive landed nobility].

Simultaneously with the beginning of manufactures there was a period of vagabondage caused
by the abolition of the feudal bodies of retainers, the disbanding of the swollen armies which
had flocked to serve the kings against their vassals, the improvement of agriculture, and the
transformation of great strips of tillage into pasture land. From this alone it is clear how this


vagabondage is strictly connected with the disintegration of the feudal system. As early as the
thirteenth century we find isolated epochs of this kind, but only at the end of the fifteenth and
beginning of the sixteenth does this vagabondage make a general and permanent appearance.
These vagabonds, who were so numerous that, for instance, Henry VIII of England had 72,000
of them hanged, were only prevailed upon to work with the greatest difficulty and through the
most extreme necessity, and then only after long resistance. The rapid rise of manufactures,
particularly in England, absorbed them gradually.

With the advent of manufactures, the various nations entered into a competitive relationship, the
struggle for trade, which was fought out in wars, protective duties and prohibitions, whereas
earlier the nations, insofar as they were connected at all, had carried on an inoffensive exchange
with each other. Trade had from now on a political significance.

With the advent of manufacture the relationship between worker and employer changed. In the
guilds the patriarchal relationship between journeyman and master continued to exist; in
manufacture its place was taken by the monetary relation between worker and capitalist - a
relationship which in the countryside and in small towns retained a patriarchal tinge, but in the
larger, the real manufacturing towns, quite early lost almost all patriarchal complexion.

Manufacture and the movement of production in general received an enormous impetus through
the extension of commerce which came with the discovery of America and the sea-route to the
East Indies. The new products imported thence, particularly the masses of gold and silver which
came into circulation and totally changed the position of the classes towards one another,
dealing a hard blow to feudal landed property and to the workers; the expeditions of
adventurers, colonisation; and above all the extension of markets into a world market, which
had now become possible and was daily becoming more and more a fact, called forth a new
phase of historical development, into which in general we cannot here enter further. Through the
colonisation of the newly discovered countries the commercial struggle of the nations amongst
one another was given new fuel and accordingly greater extension and animosity.

The expansion of trade and manufacture accelerated the accumulation of movable capital, while
in the guilds, which were not stimulated to extend their production, natural capital remained
stationary or even declined. Trade and manufacture created the big bourgeoisie; in the guilds
was concentrated the petty bourgeoisie, which no longer was dominant in the towns as formerly,
but had to bow to the might of the great merchants and manufacturers. Hence the decline of the
guilds, as soon as they came into contact with manufacture.

The intercourse of nations took on, in the epoch of which we have been speaking, two different
forms. At first the small quantity of gold and silver in circulation involved the ban on the export
of these metals; and industry, for the most part imported from abroad and made necessary by the
need for employing the growing urban population, could not do without those privileges which
could be granted not only, of course, against home competition, but chiefly against foreign. The
local guild privilege was in these original prohibitions extended over the whole nation. Customs
duties originated from the tributes which the feudal lords exacted as protective levies against
robbery from merchants passing through their territories, tributes later imposed likewise by the
towns, and which, with the rise of the modern states, were the Treasury's most obvious means of
raising money.

The appearance of American gold and silver on the European markets, the gradual development
of industry, the rapid expansion of trade and the consequent rise of the non-guild bourgeoisie
and of money, gave these measures another significance. The State, which was daily less and
less able to do without money, now retained the ban on the export of gold and silver out of fiscal
considerations; the bourgeois, for whom these masses of money which were hurled onto the
market became the chief object of speculative buying, were thoroughly content with this;
privileges established earlier became a source of income for the government and were sold for
money; in the customs legislation there appeared the export duty, which, since it only [placed] a
hindrance in the way of industry, had a purely fiscal aim.

The second period began in the middle of the seventeenth century and lasted almost to the end
of the eighteenth. Commerce and navigation had expanded more rapidly than manufacture,
which played a secondary role; the colonies were becoming considerable consumers; and after
long struggles the separate nations shared out the opening world market among themselves. This


period begins with the Navigation Laws [2] and colonial monopolies. The competition of the
nations among themselves was excluded as far as possible by tariffs, prohibitions and treaties;
and in the last resort the competitive struggle was carried on and decided by wars (especially
naval wars). The mightiest maritime nation, the English, retained preponderance in trade and
manufacture. Here, already, we find concentration in one country.

Manufacture was all the time sheltered by protective duties in the home market, by monopolies
in the colonial market, and abroad as much as possible by differential duties. The working-up of
home-produced material was encouraged (wool and linen in England, silk in France), the export
of home-produced raw material forbidden (wool in England), and the [working-up] of imported
material neglected or suppressed (cotton in England). The nation dominant in sea trade and
colonial power naturally secured for itself also the greatest quantitative and qualitative
expansion of manufacture. Manufacture could not be carried on without protection, since, if the
slightest change takes place in other countries, it can lose its market and be ruined; under
reasonably favourable conditions it may easily be introduced into a country, but for this very
reason can easily be destroyed. At the same time through the mode in which it is carried on,
particularly in the eighteenth century, in the countryside, it is to such an extent interwoven with
the vital relationships of a great mass of individuals, that no country dare jeopardise its
existence by permitting free competition. Insofar as it manages to export, it therefore depends
entirely on the extension or restriction of commerce, and exercises a relatively very small
reaction [on the latter]. Hence its secondary [importance] and the influence of [the merchants] in
the eighteenth century. It was the merchants and especially the shippers who more than anybody
else pressed for State protection and monopolies; the manufacturers also demanded and indeed
received protection, but all the time were inferior in political importance to the merchants. The
commercial towns, particularly the maritime towns, became to some extent civilised and
acquired the outlook of the big bourgeoisie, but in the factory towns an extreme petty-bourgeois
outlook persisted. Cf Aikin, etc. The eighteenth century was the century of trade. Pinto says this
expressly: ‘Commerce is the rage of the century.’ ‘For some time now people have been talking
only about commerce, navigation and the navy.’ [In French in the original]

This period is also characterised by the cessation of the bans on the export of gold and silver and
the beginning of the trade in money; by banks, national debts, paper money; by speculation in
stocks and shares and stockjobbing in all articles; by the development of finance in general.
Again capital lost a great part of the natural character which had still clung to it.

```
[4. Most Extensive Division of Labour.
Large-Scale Industry]
```
The concentration of trade and manufacture in one country, England, developing irresistibly in
the seventeenth century, gradually created for this country a relative world market, and thus a
demand for the manufactured products of this country, which could no longer be met by the
industrial productive forces hitherto existing. This demand, outgrowing the productive forces,
was the motive power which, by producing big industry - the application of elemental forces to
industrial ends, machinery and the most complex division of labour - called into existence the
third period of private ownership since the Middle Ages. There already existed in England the
other pre-conditions of this new phase: freedom of competition inside the nation, the
development of theoretical mechanics, etc. (Indeed, the science of mechanics perfected by
Newton was altogether the most popular science in France and England in the eighteenth
century.) (Free competition inside the nation itself had everywhere to be conquered by a
revolution - 1640 and 1688 in England, 1789 in France.)

Competition soon compelled every country that wished to retain its historical role to protect its
manufactures by renewed customs regulations (the old duties were no longer any good against
big industry) and soon after to introduce big industry under protective duties. Big industry
universalised competition in spite of these protective measures (it is practical free trade; the
protective duty is only a palliative, a measure of defence within free trade), established means of
communication and the modern world market, subordinated trade to itself, transformed all
capital into industrial capital, and thus produced the rapid circulation (development of the
financial system) and the centralisation of capital. By universal competition it forced all
individuals to strain their energy to the utmost. It destroyed as far as possible ideology, religion,


morality, etc. and where it could not do this, made them into a palpable lie. It produced world
history for the first time, insofar as it made all civilised nations and every individual member of
them dependent for the satisfaction of their wants on the whole world, thus destroying the
former natural exclusiveness of separate nations. It made natural science subservient to capital
and took from the division of labour the last semblance of its natural character. It destroyed
natural growth in general, as far as this is possible while labour exists, and resolved all natural
relationships into money relationships. In the place of naturally grown towns it created the
modern, large industrial cities which have sprung up overnight. Wherever it penetrated, it
destroyed the crafts and all earlier stages of industry. It completed the victory of the commercial
town over the countryside. [Its first premise] was the automatic system. [Its development]
produced a mass of productive forces, for which private [property] became just as much a fetter
as the guild had been for manufacture and the small, rural workshop for the developing craft.
These productive forces received under the system of private property a one-sided development
only, and became for the majority destructive forces; moreover, a great multitude of such forces
could find no application at all within this system. Generally speaking, big industry created
everywhere the same relations between the classes of society, and thus destroyed the peculiar
individuality of the various nationalities. And finally, while the bourgeoisie of each nation still
retained separate national interests, big industry created a class, which in all nations has the
same interest and with which nationality is already dead; a class which is really rid of all the old
world and at the same time stands pitted against it. Big industry makes for the worker not only
the relation to the capitalist, but labour itself, unbearable.

It is evident that big industry does not reach the same level of development in all districts of a
country. This does not, however, retard the class movement of the proletariat, because the
proletarians created by big industry assume leadership of this movement and carry the whole
mass along with them, and because the workers excluded from big industry are placed by it in a
still worse situation than the workers in big industry itself. The countries in which big industry
is developed act in a similar manner upon the more or less non-industrial countries, insofar as
the latter are swept by universal commerce into the universal competitive struggle. [4]

These different forms are just so many forms of the organisation of labour, and hence of
property. In each period a unification of the existing productive forces takes place, insofar as
this has been rendered necessary by needs.

The Relation of State and Law to Property

The first form of property, in the ancient world as in the Middle Ages, is tribal property,
determined with the Romans chiefly by war, with the Germans by the rearing of cattle. In the
case of the ancient peoples, since several tribes live together in one town, the tribal property
appears as State property, and the right of the individual to it as mere ‘possession’ which,
however, like tribal property as a whole, is confined to landed property only. Real private
property began with the ancients, as with modern nations, with movable property. - (Slavery and
community) (dominium ex jure Quiritum). In the case of the nations which grew out of the
Middle Ages, tribal property evolved through various stages - feudal landed property,
corporative movable property, capital invested in manufacture - to modern capital, determined
by big industry and universal competition, i.e. pure private property, which has cast off all
semblance of a communal institution and has shut out the State from any influence on the
development of property. To this modern private property corresponds the modern State, which,
purchased gradually by the owners of property by means of taxation, has fallen entirely into
their hands through the national debt, and its existence has become wholly dependent on the
commercial credit which the owners of property, the bourgeois, extend to it, as reflected in the
rise and fall of State funds on the stock exchange. By the mere fact that it is a class and no
longer an estate, the bourgeoisie is forced to organise itself no longer locally, but nationally, and
to give a general form to its mean average interest. Through the emancipation of private
property from the community, the State has become a separate entity, beside and outside civil
society; but it is nothing more than the form of organisation which the bourgeois necessarily
adopt both for internal and external purposes, for the mutual guarantee of their property and
interests. The independence of the State is only found nowadays in those countries where the
estates have not yet completely developed into classes, where the estates, done away with in


more advanced countries, still have a part to play, and where there exists a mixture; countries,
that is to say, in which no one section of the population can achieve dominance over the others.
This is the case particularly in Germany. The most perfect example of the modern State is North
America. The modern French, English and American writers all express the opinion that the
State exists only for the sake of private property, so that this fact has penetrated into the
consciousness of the normal man.

Since the State is the form in which the individuals of a ruling class assert their common
interests, and in which the whole civil society of an epoch is epitomised, it follows that the State
mediates in the formation of all common institutions and that the institutions receive a political
form. Hence the illusion that law is based on the will, and indeed on the will divorced from its
real basis - on free will. Similarly, justice is in its turn reduced to the actual laws.

Civil law develops simultaneously with private property out of the disintegration of the natural
community. With the Romans the development of private property and civil law had no further
industrial and commercial consequences, because their whole mode of production did not alter.
(Usury!)

With modern peoples, where the feudal community was disintegrated by industry and trade,
there began with the rise of private property and civil law a new phase, which was capable of
further development. The very first town which carried on an extensive maritime trade in the
Middle Ages, Amalfi, also developed maritime law. As soon as industry and trade developed
private property further, first in Italy and later in other countries, the highly developed Roman
civil law was immediately adopted again and raised, to authority. When later the bourgeoisie
had acquired so much power that the princes took up its interests in order to overthrow the
feudal nobility by means of the bourgeoisie, there began in all countries - in France in the
sixteenth century - the real development of law, which in all countries except England
proceeded on the basis of the Roman Codex. In England, too, Roman legal principles had to be
introduced to further the development of civil law (especially in the case of movable property).
(It must not be forgotten that law has just as little an independent history as religion.)

In civil law the existing property relationships are declared to be the result of the general will.
The jus utendi et abutendi itself asserts on the one hand the fact that private property has
become entirely independent of the community, and on the other the illusion that private
property itself is based solely on the private will, the arbitrary disposal of the thing. In practice,
the abuti has very definite economic limitations for the owner of private property, if he does not
wish to see his property and hence his jus abutendi pass into other hands, since actually the
thing, considered merely with reference to his will, is not a thing at all, but only becomes a
thing, true property in intercourse, and independently of the law (a relationship, which the
philosophers call an idea). This juridical illusion, which reduces law to the mere will,
necessarily leads, in the further development of property relationships, to the position that a man
may have a legal title to a thing without really having the thing. If, for instance, the income from
a piece of land is lost owing to competition, then the proprietor has certainly his legal title to it
along with the jus utendi et abutendi. But he can do nothing with it: he owns nothing as a landed
proprietor if in addition he has not enough capital to cultivate his ground. This illusion of the
jurists also explains the fact that for them, as for every code, it is altogether fortuitous that
individuals enter into relationships among themselves (e.g. contracts); it explains why they
consider that these relationships [can] be entered into or not at will, and that their content rests
purely on the individual [free] will of the contracting parties.

Whenever, through the development of industry and commerce, new forms of intercourse have
been evolved (e.g. assurance companies, etc.), the law has always been compelled to admit them
among the modes of acquiring property.

Notes, written by Marx, intended for further elaboration

12. Forms of Social Consciousness

The influence of the division of labour on science.

The role of repression with regard to the state, law, morality, etc.

It is precisely because the bourgeoisie rules as a class that in the law it must give itself a general
expression.


Natural science and history.

There is no history of politics, law, science, etc., of art, religion, etc.

[Marginal note by Marx:] To the ‘community’ as it appears in the ancient state, in feudalism and
in the absolute monarchy, to this bond correspond especially the religious conceptions.

Why the ideologists turn everything upside-down.

Clerics, jurists, politicians.

jurists, politicians (statesmen in general), moralists, clerics.

For this ideological subdivision within a class: 1) The occupation assumes an independent
existence owing to division of labour. Everyone believes his craft to be the true one. Illusions
regarding the connection between their craft and reality are the more likely to be cherished by
them because of the very nature of the craft. In consciousness - in jurisprudence, politics, etc. -
relations become concepts; since they do not go beyond these relations, the concepts of the
relations also become fixed concepts in their mind. The judge, for example, applies the code, he
therefore regards legislation as the real, active driving force. Respect for their goods, because
their craft deals with general matters.

Idea of law. Idea of state. The matter is turned upside-down in ordinary consciousness.

Religion is from the outset consciousness of the transcendental arising from actually existing
forces.

This more popularly.

Tradition, with regard to law, religion, etc.

Individuals always proceeded, and always proceed, from themselves. Their relations are the
relations of their real life-process. How does it happen that their relations assume an
independent existence over against them? and that the forces of their own life become superior
to them?

In short: division of labour, the level of which depends on the development of the productive
power at any particular time.

Landed property. Communal property. Feudal. Modern.

Estate property. Manufacturing property. Industrial capital.
