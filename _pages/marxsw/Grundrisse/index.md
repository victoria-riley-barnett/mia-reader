### Production, Consumption, Distribution, Exchange (Circulation)

#### (1) Production

Independent Individuals. Eighteenth-century Ideas.

The object before us, to begin with, material production.

Individuals producing in Society - hence socially determined individual production - is, of
course, the point of departure. The individual and isolated hunter and fisherman, with whom
Smith and Ricardo begin, belongs among the unimaginative conceits of the eighteenth-century
Robinsonades,  - 1 which in no way express merely a reaction against over-
sophistication and a return to a misunderstood natural life, as cultural historians imagine. As
little as Rousseau’s contrat social, which brings naturally independent, autonomous subjects
into relation and connection by contract, rests on such naturalism. This is the semblance, the
merely aesthetic semblance, of the Robinsonades, great and small. It is, rather, the anticipation
of ‘civil society’, in preparation since the sixteenth century and making giant strides towards
maturity in the eighteenth. In this society of free competition, the individual appears detached
from the natural bonds etc. which in earlier historical periods make him the accessory of a
definite and limited human conglomerate. Smith and Ricardo still stand with both feet on the
shoulders of the eighteenth-century prophets, in whose imaginations this eighteenth-century
individual - the product on one side of the dissolution of the feudal forms of society, on the
other side of the new forces of production developed since the sixteenth century - appears as an
ideal, whose existence they project into the past. Not as a historic result but as history’s point of
departure. As the Natural Individual appropriate to their notion of human nature, not arising
historically, but posited by nature. This illusion has been common to each new epoch to this
day. Steuart  - 2 avoided this simple-mindedness because as an aristocrat and in
antithesis to the eighteenth century, he had in some respects a more historical footing.

The more deeply we go back into history, the more does the individual, and hence also the
producing individual, appear as dependent, as belonging to a greater whole: in a still quite
natural way in the family and in the family expanded into the clan [Stamm]; then later in the
various forms of communal society arising out of the antitheses and fusions of the clan. Only in
the eighteenth century, in ‘civil society’, do the various forms of social connectedness confront
the individual as a mere means towards his private purposes, as external necessity. But the
epoch which produces this standpoint, that of the isolated individual, is also precisely that of the
hitherto most developed social (from this standpoint, general) relations. The human being is in
the most literal sense not merely a gregarious animal, but an
animal which can individuate itself only in the midst of society. Production by an isolated
individual outside society - a rare exception which may well occur when a civilized person in
whom the social forces are already dynamically present is cast by accident into the wilderness -
is as much of an absurdity as is the development of language without individuals living together
and talking to each other. There is no point in dwelling on this any longer. The point could go
entirely unmentioned if this twaddle, which had sense and reason for the eighteenth-century
characters, had not been earnestly pulled back into the centre of the most modern economics by
Bastiat,  - 4 Carey,  - 5 Proudhon etc. Of course it is a convenience for
Proudhon et al. to be able to give a historico-philosophic account of the source of an economic
relation, of whose historic origins he is ignorant, by inventing the myth that Adam or
Prometheus stumbled on the idea ready-made, and then it was adopted, etc. Nothing is more dry
and boring than the fantasies of a locus communis. - 6

Eternalization of historic relations of production - Production and
distribution in general. - Property
```

Whenever we speak of production, then, what is meant is always production at a definite stage
of social development - production by social individuals. It might seem, therefore, that in order
to talk about production at all we must either pursue the process of historic development
through its different phases, or declare beforehand that we are dealing with a specific historic
epoch such as e.g. modern bourgeois production, which is indeed our particular theme.
However, all epochs of production have certain common traits, common characteristics.
Production in general is an abstraction, but a rational abstraction in so far as it really brings out
and fixes the common element and thus saves us repetition. Still, this general category, this
common element sifted out by comparison, is itself segmented many times over and splits into
different determinations. Some determinations belong to all epochs, others only to a few.
[Some] determinations will be shared by the most modern epoch and the most ancient. No
production will be thinkable without them; however even though the most developed languages
have laws and characteristics in common with the least developed, nevertheless, just those
things which determine their development, i.e. the elements which are not general and common,
must be separated out from the determinations valid for production as such, so that in their unity which arises already from the identity of the subject, humanity, and of the object, nature - their
essential difference is not forgotten. The whole profundity of those modern economists who
demonstrate the eternity and harmoniousness of the existing social relations lies in this
forgetting. For example. No production possible without an instrument of production, even if
this instrument is only the hand. No production without stored-up, past labour, even if it is only
the facility gathered together and concentrated in the hand of the savage by repeated practice.
Capital is, among other things, also an instrument of production, also objectified, past labour.
Therefore capital is a general, eternal relation of nature; that is, if I leave out just the specific
quality which alone makes ‘instrument of production’ and ‘stored-up labour’ into capital. The
entire history of production relations thus appears to Carey, for example, as a malicious forgery
perpetrated by governments.

If there is no production in general, then there is also no general production. Production is
always a particular branch of production - e.g. agriculture, cattle-raising manufactures etc. - or
it is a totality. But political economy is not technology. The relation of the general
characteristics of production at a given stage of social development to the particular forms of
production to be developed elsewhere (later). Lastly, production also is not only a particular
production. Rather, it is always a certain social body, a social subject, which is active in a
greater or sparser totality of branches of production. Nor does the relationship between scientific
presentation and the real movement belong here yet. Production in general. Particular branches
of production. Totality of production.

It is the fashion to preface a work of economics with a general part - and precisely this part
figures under the title ‘production’ (see for example J. St. Mill) - 7 - treating of the
general preconditions of all production. This general part consists or is alleged to consist of (1)
the conditions without which production is not possible. I.e. in fact, to indicate nothing more
than the essential moments of all production. But, as we will see, this reduces itself in fact to a
few very simple characteristics, which are hammered out into flat tautologies; (2) the conditions
which promote production to a greater or lesser degree, such as e.g. Adam Smith’s progressive
and stagnant state of society. While this is of value in his work as an insight, to elevate it to
scientific significance would require investigations into the periodization of degrees of
productivity in the development of individual peoples - an investigation which lies outside the
proper boundaries of the theme, but, in so far as it does belong there, must be brought in as part
of the development of competition, accumulation etc. In the usual formulation, the answer
amounts to the general statement that an industrial people reaches the peak of its production at
the moment when it arrives at its historical peak generally. In fact. The industrial peak of a
people when its main concern is not yet gain, but rather to gain. Thus the Yankees over the
English. Or, also, that e.g. certain races, locations, climates, natural conditions such as harbours,
soil fertility etc. are more advantageous to production than others. This too amounts to the
tautology that wealth is more easily created where its elements are subjectively and objectively
present to a greater degree.


But none of all this is the economists’ real concern in this general part. The aim is, rather, to
present production - see e.g. Mill - as distinct from distribution etc., as encased in eternal natural
laws independent of history, at which opportunity bourgeois relations are then quietly smuggled
in as the inviolable natural laws on which society in the abstract is founded. This is the more or
less conscious purpose of the whole proceeding. In distribution, by contrast, humanity has
allegedly permitted itself to be considerably more arbitrary. Quite apart from this crude tearing-
apart of production and distribution and of their real relationship, it must be apparent from the
outset that, no matter how differently distribution may have been arranged in different stages of
social development, it must be possible here also, just as with production, to single out common
characteristics, and just as possible to confound or to extinguish all historic differences under
general human laws. For example, the slave, the serf and the wage labourer all receive a
quantity of food which makes it possible for them to exist as slaves, as serfs, as wage labourers.
The conqueror who lives from tribute, or the official who lives from taxes, or the landed
proprietor and his rent, or the monk and his alms, or the Levite and his tithe, all receive a quota
of social production, which is determined by other laws than that of the slave’s, etc. The two
main points which all economists cite under this rubric are: (1) property; (2) its protection by
courts, police, etc. To this a very short answer may be given:

All production is appropriation of nature on the part of an individual within and through a
specific form of society. In this sense it is a tautology to say that property (appropriation) is a
precondition of production. But it is altogether ridiculous to leap from that to a specific form of
property, e.g. private property. (Which further and equally presupposes an antithetical form,
non-property.) History rather shows common property (e.g. in lndia, among the Slavs, the early
Celts, etc.) to be the more  - 8 original form, a form which long continues to play a
significant role in the shape of communal property. The question whether wealth develops better
in this or another form of property is still quite beside the point here. But that there can be no
production and hence no society where some form of property does not exist is a tautology. An
appropriation which does not make something into property is a contradictio in subjecto.

Protection of acquisitions etc. When these trivialities are reduced to their real content, they
tell more than their preachers know. Namely that every form of production creates its own legal
relations, form of government, etc. In bringing things which are organically related into an
accidental relation, into a merely reflective connection, they display their crudity and lack of
conceptual understanding. All the bourgeois economists are aware of is that production can be
carried on better under the modern police than e.g. on the principle of might makes right. They
forget only that this principle is also a legal relation, and that the right of the stronger prevails in
their ‘constitutional republics’ as well, only in another form.

When the social conditions corresponding to a specific stage of production are only just arising,
or when they are already dying out, there are, naturally, disturbances in production, although to
different degrees and with different effects.

To summarize: There are characteristics which all stages of production have in common, and
which are established as general ones by the mind; but the so-called general preconditions of all
production are nothing more than these abstract moments with which no real historical stage of
production can be grasped.

### (2) The General Relation of Production to Distribution, Exchange, Consumption

Before going further in the analysis of production, it is necessary to focus on the various
categories which the economists line up next to it.

The obvious, trite notion: in production the members of society appropriate (create, shape) the
products of nature in accord with human needs; distribution determines the proportion in which
the individual shares in the product; exchange delivers the particular products into which the
individual desires to convert the portion which distribution has assigned to him; and finally, in
consumption, the products become objects of gratification, of individual appropriation.
Production creates the objects which correspond to the given needs; distribution divides them up
according to social laws; exchange further parcels out the already divided shares in accord with
individual needs; and finally, in consumption, the product steps outside this social movement


and becomes a direct object and servant of individual need, and satisfies it in being consumed.
Thus production appears as the point of departure, consumption as the conclusion, distribution
and exchange as the middle, which is however itself twofold, since distribution is determined by
society and exchange by individuals. The person objectifies himself in production, the thing
subjectifies itself in the person;  - 9 in distribution, society mediates between
production and consumption in the form of general, dominant determinants; in exchange the two
are mediated by the chance characteristics of the individual.

Distribution determines the relation in which products fall to individuals (the amount); exchange
determines the productionintro-f.htm - 10 in which the individual demands the portion allotted
to him by distribution.

Thus production, distribution, exchange and consumption form a regular syllogism; production
is the generality, distribution and exchange the particularity, and consumption the singularity in
which the whole is joined together. This is admittedly a coherence, but a shallow one.
Production is determined by general natural laws, distribution by social accident, and the latter
may therefore promote production to a greater or lesser extent; exchange stands between the two
as formal social movement; and the concluding act, consumption, which is conceived not only
as a terminal point but also as an end-in-itself, actually belongs outside economics except in so
far as it reacts in turn upon the point of departure and initiates the whole process anew.

The opponents of the political economists - whether inside or outside its realm - who accuse
them of barbarically tearing apart things which belong together, stand either on the same ground
as they, or beneath them. Nothing is more common than the reproach that the political
economists view production too much as an end in itself, that distribution is just as important.
This accusation is based precisely on the economic notion that the spheres of distribution and of
production are independent, autonomous neighbours. Or that these moments were not grasped in
their unity. As if this rupture had made its way not from reality into the textbooks, but rather
from the textbooks into reality, and as if the task were the dialectic balancing of concepts, and
not the grasping of real relations!

#### Consumption and Production

(a) Production is also immediately consumption. Twofold consumption, subjective and
objective: the individual not only develops his abilities in production, but also expends them,
uses them up in the act of production, just as natural procreation is a consumption of life forces.
Secondly: consumption of the means of production, which become worn out through use, and
are partly (e.g. in combustion) dissolved into their elements again. Likewise, consumption of the
raw material, which loses its natural form and composition by being used up. The act of
production is therefore in all its moments also an act of consumption. But the economists admit
this. Production as directly identical with consumption, and consumption as directly coincident
with production, is termed by them productive consumption. This identity of production and
consumption amounts to Spinoza’s thesis: determinatio est negatio.  - 11

But this definition of productive consumption is advanced only for the purpose of separating
consumption as identical with production from consumption proper, which is conceived rather
as the destructive antithesis to production. Let us therefore examine consumption proper.

Consumption is also immediately production, just as in nature the consumption of the elements
and chemical substances is the production of the plant. It is clear that in taking in food, for
example, which is a form of consumption, the human being produces his own body. But this is
also true of every kind of consumption which in one way or another produces human beings in
some particular aspect. Consumptive production. But, says economics, this production which is
identical with consumption is secondary, it is derived from the destruction of the prior product.
In the former, the producer objectified himself, in the latter, the object he created personifies
itself. Hence this consumptive production - even though it is an immediate unity of production
and consumption - is essentially different from production proper. The immediate unity in
which production coincides with consumption and consumption with production leaves their
immediate duality intact.

Production, then, is also immediately consumption, consumption is also immediately
production. Each is immediately its opposite. But at the same time a mediating movement takes


place between the two. Production mediates consumption; it creates the latter’s material;
without it, consumption would lack an object. But consumption also mediates production, in
that it alone creates for the products the subject for whom they are products. The product only
obtains its ‘last finish’intro-f.htm - 12 in consumption. A railway on which no trains run, hence
which is not used up, not consumed, is a railway only   - 13 and not in
reality. Without production, no consumption; but also, without consumption, no production;
since production would then be purposeless. Consumption produces production in a double way,
(1) because a product becomes a real product only by being consumed. For example, a garment
becomes a real garment only in the act of being worn; a house where no one lives is in fact not a
real house; thus the product, unlike a mere natural object, proves itself to be, becomes, a product
only through consumption. Only by decomposing the product does consumption give the
product the finishing touch; for the product is production not as  - 14 objectified
activity, but rather only as object for the active subject; (2) because consumption creates the
need for new production, that is it creates the ideal, internally impelling cause for production,
which is its presupposition. Consumption creates the motive for production; it also creates the
object which is active in production as its determinant aim. If it is clear that production offers
consumption its external object, it is therefore equally clear that consumption ideally posits the
object of production as an internal image, as a need, as drive and as purpose. It creates the
objects of production in a still subjective form. No production without a need. But consumption
reproduces the need.

Production, for its part, correspondingly (1) furnishes the material and the object for
consumption.  - 15 Consumption without an object is not consumption; therefore, in
this respect, production creates, produces consumption. (2) But the object is not the only thing
which production creates for consumption. Production also gives consumption its specificity, its
character, its finish. Just as consumption gave the product its finish as product, so does
production give finish to consumption. Firstly, the object is not an object in general, but a
specific object which must be consumed in a specific manner, to be mediated in its turn by
production itself. Hunger is hunger, but the hunger gratified by cooked meat eaten with a knife
and fork is a different hunger from that which bolts down raw meat with the aid of hand, nail
and tooth. Production thus produces not only the object but also the manner of consumption, not
only objectively but also subjectively. Production thus creates the consumer. (3) Production not
only supplies a material for the need, but it also supplies a need for the material. As soon as
consumption emerges from its initial state of natural crudity and immediacy - and, if it remained
at that stage, this would be because production itself had been arrested there - it becomes itself
mediated as a drive by the object. The need which consumption feels for the object is created by
the perception of it. The object of art - like every other product - creates a public which is
sensitive to art and enjoys beauty. Production thus not only creates an object for the subject, but
also a subject for the object. Thus production produces consumption (1) by creating the material
for it; (2) by determining the manner of consumption; and (3) by creating the products, initially
posited by it as objects, in the form of a need felt by the consumer. It thus produces the object of
consumption, the manner of consumption and the motive of consumption. Consumption
likewise produces the producer’s inclination by beckoning to him as an aim-determining need.

The identities between consumption and production thus appear threefold:

(1) Immediate identity: Production is consumption, consumption is production. Consumptive
production. Productive consumption. The political economists call both productive
consumption. But then make a further distinction. The first figures as reproduction, the second
as productive consumption. All investigations into the first concern productive or unproductive
labour; investigations into the second concern productive or non-productive consumption.

(2) [In the sense] that one appears as a means for the other, is mediated by the other: this is
expressed as their mutual dependence; a movement which relates them to one another, makes
them appear indispensable to one another, but still leaves them external to each other.
Production creates the material, as external object, for consumption; consumption creates the
need, as internal object, as aim, for production. Without production no consumption; without
consumption no production. [This identity] figures in economics in many different forms.

(3) Not only is production immediately consumption and consumption immediately production,
not only is production a means for consumption and consumption the aim of production, i.e.


each supplies the other with its object (production supplying the external object of consumption,
consumption the conceived object of production); but also, each of them, apart from being
immediately the other, and apart from mediating the other, in addition to this creates the other in
completing itself, and creates itself as the other. Consumption accomplishes the act of
production only in completing the product as product by dissolving it, by consuming its
independently material form, by raising the inclination developed in the first act of production,
through the need for repetition, to its finished form; it is thus not only the concluding act in
which the product becomes product, but also that in which the producer becomes producer. On
the other side, production produces consumption by creating the specific manner of
consumption; and, further, by creating the stimulus of consumption, the ability to consume, as a
need. This last identity, as determined under (3), (is) frequently cited in economics in the
relation of demand and supply, of objects and needs, of socially created and natural needs.

Thereupon, nothing simpler for a Hegelian than to posit production and consumption as
identical. And this has been done not only by socialist belletrists but by prosaic economists
themselves, e.g. Say;  - 16 in the form that when one looks at an entire people, its
production is its consumption. Or, indeed, at humanity in the abstract. Storch  - 17
demonstrated Say’s error, namely that e.g. a people does not consume its entire product, but also
creates means of production, etc., fixed capital, etc. To regard society as one single subject is, in
addition, to look at it wrongly; speculatively. With a single subject, production and consumption
appear as moments of a single act. The important thing to emphasize here is only that, whether
production and consumption are viewed as the activity of one or of many individuals, they
appear in any case as moments of one process, in which production is the real point of departure
and hence also the predominant moment. Consumption as urgency, as need, is itself an intrinsic
moment of productive activity. But the latter is the point of departure for realization and hence
also its predominant moment; it is the act through which the whole process again runs its
course. The individual produces an object and, by consuming it, returns to himself, but returns
as a productive and self-reproducing individual. Consumption thus appears as a moment of
production.

In society, however, the producer’s relation to the product, once the latter is finished, is an
external one, and its return to the subject depends on his relations to other individuals. He does
not come into possession of it directly. Nor is its immediate appropriation his purpose when he
produces in society. Distribution steps between the producers and the products, hence between
production and consumption, to determine in accordance with social laws what the producer’s
share will be in the world of products.

Now, does distribution stand at the side of and outside production as an autonomous sphere?

Distribution and production

(b) When one examines the usual works of economics, it is immediately striking that everything
in them is posited doubly. For example, ground rent, wages, interest and profit figure under
distribution, while land, labour and capital figure under production as agents of production. In
the case of capital, now, it is evident from the outset that it is posited doubly, (1) as agent of
production, (2) as source of income, as a determinant of specific forms of distribution. Interest
and profit thus also figure as such in production, in so far as they are forms in which capital
increases, grows, hence moments of its own production. Interest and profit as forms of
distribution presuppose capital as agent of production. They are modes of distribution whose
presupposition is capital as agent of production. They are, likewise, modes of reproduction of
capital.

The category of wages, similarly, is the same as that which is examined under a different
heading as wage labour: the characteristic which labour here possesses as an agent of production
appears as a characteristic of distribution. If labour were not specified as wage labour, then the
manner in which it shares in the products would not appear as wages; as, for example, under
slavery. Finally, to take at once the most developed form of distribution, ground rent, by means
of which landed property shares in the product, presupposes large-scale landed property
(actually, large-scale agriculture) as agent of production, and not merely land as such, just as
wages do not merely presuppose labour as such. The relations and modes of distribution thus
appear merely as the obverse of the agents of production. An individual who participates in


production in the form of wage labour shares in the products, in the results of production, in the
form of wages. The structure [Gliederung] of distribution is completely determined by the
structure of production. Distribution is itself a product of production, not only in its object, in
that only the results of production can be distributed, but also in its form, in that the specific
kind of participation in production determines the specific forms of distribution, i.e. the pattern
of participation in distribution. It is altogether an illusion to posit land in production, ground
rend in distribution, etc.

Thus, economists such as Ricardo, who are the most frequently accused of focusing on
production alone, have defined distribution as the exclusive object of economics, because they
instinctively conceived the forms of distribution as the most specific expression into which the
agents of production of a given society are cast.

To the single individual, of course, distribution appears as a social law which determines his
position within the system of production within which he produces, and which therefore
precedes production. The individual comes into the world possessing neither capital nor land.
Social distribution assigns him at birth to wage labour. But this situation of being assigned is
itself a consequence of the existence of capital and landed property as independent agents of
production.

As regards whole societies, distribution seems to precede production and to determine it in yet
another respect, almost as if it were a pre-economic fact. A conquering people divides the land
among the conquerors, thus imposes a certain distribution and form of property in land, and thus
determines production. Or it enslaves the conquered and so makes slave labour the foundation
of production. Or a people rises in revolution and smashes the great landed estates into small
parcels, and hence, by this new distribution, gives production a new character. Or a system of
laws assigns property in land to certain families in perpetuity, or distributes labour [as] a
hereditary privilege and thus confines it within certain castes. In all these cases, and they are all
historical, it seems that distribution is not structured and determined by production, but rather
the opposite, production by distribution.

In the shallowest conception, distribution appears as the distribution of products, and hence as
further removed from and quasi-independent of production. But before distribution can be the
distribution of products, it is: (1) the distribution of the instruments of production, and (2),
which is a further specification of the same relation, the distribution of the members of the
society among the different kinds of production. (Subsumption of the individuals under specific
relations of production.) The distribution of products is evidently only a result of this
distribution, which is comprised within the process of production itself and determines the
structure of production. To examine production while disregarding this internal distribution
within it is obviously an empty abstraction; while conversely, the distribution of products
follows by itself from this distribution which forms an original moment of production. Ricardo,
whose concern was to grasp the specific social structure of modern production, and who is the
economist of production par excellence, declares for precisely that reason that not production
but distribution is the proper study of modern economics.  - 18 This again shows the
ineptitude of those economists who portray production as an eternal truth while banishing
history to the realm of distribution.

The question of the relation between this production-determining distribution, and production,
belongs evidently within production itself. If it is said that, since production must begin with a
certain distribution of the instruments of production, it follows that distribution at least in this
sense precedes and forms the presupposition of production, then the reply must be that
production does indeed have its determinants and preconditions which form its moments. At the
very beginning these may appear as spontaneous, natural. But by the process of production itself
they are transformed from natural into historic determinants, and if they appear to one epoch as
natural presuppositions of production, they were its historic product for another. Within
production itself they are constantly being changed. The application of machinery, for example,
changed the distribution of instruments of production as well as of products. Modern large-scale
landed property is itself the product of modern commerce and of modern industry, as well as of
the application of the latter to agriculture.

The questions raised above all reduce themselves in the last instance to the role played by
general-historical relations in production, and their relation to the movement of history


generally. The question evidently belongs within the treatment and investigation of production
itself.

Still, in the trivial form in which they are raised above, they can be dealt with equally briefly. In
all cases of conquest, three things are possible. The conquering people subjugates the conquered
under its own mode of production (e.g. the English in Ireland in this century, and partly in
India); or it leaves the old mode intact and contents itself with a tribute (e.g. Turks and
Romans); or a reciprocal interaction takes place whereby some thing new, a synthesis, arises
(the Germanic conquests, in part). In all cases, the mode of production, whether that of the
conquering people, that of the conquered, or that emerging from the fusion of both, is decisive
for the new distribution which arises. Although the latter appears as a presupposition of the new
period of production, it is thus itself in turn a product of production, not only of historical
production generally, but of the specific historic mode of production.

The Mongols, with their devastations in Russia, e.g., were acting in accordance with their
production, cattle-raising, for which vast uninhabited spaces are a chief precondition. The
Germanic barbarians, who lived in isolation on the land and for whom agriculture with
bondsmen was the traditional production, could impose these conditions on the Roman
provinces all the more easily as the concentration of landed property which had taken place
there had already entirely overthrown the earlier agricultural relations.

It is a received opinion that in certain periods people lived from pillage alone. But, for pillage to
be possible, there must be some thing to be pillaged, hence production. And the mode of pillage
is itself in turn determined by the mode of production. A stock jobbing nation, for example,
cannot be pillaged in the same manner as a nation of cow-herds.

To steal a slave is to steal the instrument of production directly. But then the production of the
country for which the slave is stolen must be structured to allow of slave labour, or (as in the
southern part of America etc.) a mode of production corresponding to the slave must be created.

Laws may perpetuate an instrument of production, e.g. land, in certain families. These laws
achieve economic significance only when large-scale landed property is in harmony with the
society’s production, as e.g. in England. In France, small-scale agriculture survived despite the
great landed estates, hence the latter were smashed by the revolution. But can laws perpetuate
the small-scale allotment? Despite these laws, ownership is again becoming concentrated. The
influence of laws in stabilizing relations of distribution, and hence their effect on production,
requires to be determined in each specific instance.

(c) Exchange, Finally, and Circulation

Exchange and production

Circulation itself [is] merely a specific moment of exchange, or [it is] also exchange regarded in
its totality.

In so far as exchange is merely a moment mediating between production with its production-
determined distribution on one side and consumption on the other, but in so far as the latter
itself appears as a moment of production, to that extent is exchange obviously also included as a
moment within the latter.

It is clear, firstly, that the exchange of activities and abilities which takes place within
production itself belongs directly to production and essentially constitutes it. The same holds,
secondly, for the exchange of products, in so far as that exchange is the means of finishing the
product and making it fit for direct consumption. To that extent, exchange is an act comprised
within production itself. Thirdly, the so-called exchange between dealers and dealers is by its
very organization entirely determined by production, as well as being itself a producing activity.
Exchange appears as independent of and indifferent to production only in the final phase where
the product is exchanged directly for consumption. But (1) there is no exchange without
division of labour, whether the latter is spontaneous, natural, or already a product of historic
development; (2) private exchange presupposes private production; (3) the intensity of
exchange, as well as its extension and its manner, are determined by the development and
structure of production. For example. Exchange between town and country; exchange in the
country, in the town etc. Exchange in all its moments thus appears as either directly comprised
in production or determined by it.


The conclusion we reach is not that production, distribution, exchange and consumption are
identical, but that they all form the members of a totality, distinctions within a unity. Production
predominates not only over itself, in the antithetical definition of production, but over the other
moments as well. The process always returns to production to begin anew. That exchange and
consumption cannot be predominant is self-evident. Likewise, distribution as distribution of
products; while as distribution of the agents of production it is itself a moment of production. A
definite production thus determines a definite consumption, distribution and exchange as well as
definite relations between these different moments. Admittedly, however, in its one-sided form,
production is itself determined by the other moments. For example if the market, i.e. the sphere
of exchange, expands, then production grows in quantity and the divisions between its different
branches become deeper. A change in distribution changes production, e.g. concentration of
capital, different distribution of the population between town and country, etc. Finally, the needs
of consumption determine production. Mutual interaction takes place between the different
moments. This the case with every organic whole.

### (3) The Method of Political Economy.....................................................................................

When we consider a given country politico-economically, we begin with its population, its
distribution among classes, town, country, the coast, the different branches of production, export
and import, annual production and consumption, commodity prices etc.

It seems to be correct to begin with the real and the concrete, with the real precondition, thus to
begin, in economics, with e.g. the population, which is the foundation and the subject of the
entire social act of production. However, on closer examination this proves false. The
population is an abstraction if I leave out, for example, the classes of which it is composed.
These classes in turn are an empty phrase if I am not familiar with the elements on which they
rest. E.g. wage labour, capital, etc. These latter in turn presuppose exchange, division of labour,
prices, etc. For example, capital is nothing without wage labour, without value, money, price
etc. Thus, if I were to begin with the population, this would be a chaotic conception
[Vorstellung] of the whole, and I would then, by means of further determination, move
analytically towards ever more simple concepts [Begriff], from the imagined concrete towards
ever thinner abstractions until I had arrived at the simplest determinations. From there the
journey would have to be retraced until I had finally arrived at the population again, but this
time not as the chaotic conception of a whole, but as a rich totality of many determinations and
relations. The former is the path historically followed by economics at the time of its origins.
The economists of the seventeenth century, e.g., always begin with the living whole, with
population, nation, state, several states, etc.; but they always conclude by discovering through
analysis a small number of determinant, abstract, general relations such as division of labour,
money, value, etc. As soon as these individual moments had been more or less firmly
established and abstracted, there began the economic systems, which ascended from the simple
relations, such as labour, division of labour, need, exchange value, to the level of the state,
exchange between nations and the world market. The latter is obviously the scientifically correct
method. The concrete is concrete because it is the concentration of many determinations, hence
unity of the diverse. It appears in the process of thinking, therefore, as a process of
concentration, as a result, not as a point of departure, even though it is the point of departure in
reality and hence also the point of departure for observation [Anschauung] and conception.
Along the first path the full conception was evaporated to yield an abstract determination; along
the second, the abstract determinations lead towards a reproduction of the concrete by way of
thought. In this way Hegel fell into the illusion of conceiving the real as the product of thought
concentrating itself, probing its own depths, and unfolding itself out of itself, by itself, whereas
the method of rising from the abstract to the concrete is only the way in which thought
appropriates the concrete, reproduces it as the concrete in the mind. But this is by no means the
process by which the concrete itself comes into being. For example, the simplest economic
category, say e.g. exchange value, presupposes population, moreover a population producing in
specific relations; as well as a certain kind of family, or commune, or state, etc. It can never
exist other than as an abstract, one-sided relation within an already given, concrete, living
whole. As a category, by contrast, exchange value leads an antediluvian existence. Therefore, to
the kind of consciousness - and this is characteristic of the philosophical consciousness - for
which conceptual thinking is the real human being, and for which the conceptual world as such


is thus the only reality, the movement of the categories appears as the real act of production -
which only, unfortunately, receives a jolt from the outside - whose product is the world; and -
but this is again a tautology - this is correct in so far as the concrete totality is a totality of
thoughts, concrete in thought, in fact a product of thinking and comprehending; but not in any
way a product of the concept which thinks and generates itself outside or above observation and
conception; a product, rather, of the working-up of observation and conception into concepts.
The totality as it appears in the head, as a totality of thoughts, is a product of a thinking head,
which appropriates the world in the only way it can, a way different from the artistic, religious,
practical and mental appropriation of this world. The real subject retains its autonomous
existence outside the head just as before; namely as long as the head’s conduct is merely
speculative, merely theoretical. Hence, in the theoretical method, too, the subject, society, must
always be kept in mind as the presupposition.

But do not these simpler categories also have an independent historical or natural existence
predating the more concrete ones? That depends. Hegel, for example, correctly begins the
Philosophy of Right with possession, this being the subject’s simplest juridical relation. But
there is no possession preceding the family or master-servant relations, which are far more
concrete relations. However, it would be correct to say that there are families or clan groups
which still merely possess, but have no property. The simple category therefore appears in
relation to property as a relation of simple families or clan groups. In the higher society it
appears as the simpler relation of a developed organization. But the concrete substratum of
which possession is a relation is always presupposed. One can imagine an individual savage as
possessing something. But in that case possession is not a juridical relation. It is incorrect that
possession develops historically into the family. Possession, rather, always presupposes this
‘more concrete juridical category’. There would still always remain this much, however, namely
that the simple categories are the expressions of relations within which the less developed
concrete may have already realized itself before having posited the more many-sided connection
or relation which is mentally expressed in the more concrete category; while the more
developed concrete preserves the same category as a subordinate relation. Money may exist, and
did exist historically, before capital existed, before banks existed, before wage labour existed,
etc. Thus in this respect it may be said that the simpler category can express the dominant
relations of a less developed whole, or else those subordinate relations of a more developed
whole which already had a historic existence before this whole developed in the direction
expressed by a more concrete category. To that extent the path of abstract thought, rising from
the simple to the combined, would correspond to the real historical process.

It may be said on the other hand that there are very developed but nevertheless historically less
mature forms of society, in which the highest forms of economy, e.g. cooperation, a developed
division of labour, etc., are found, even though there is no kind of money, e.g. Peru. Among the
Slav communities also, money and the exchange which determines it play little or no role within
the individual communities, but only on their boundaries, in traffic with others; it is simply
wrong to place exchange at the center of communal society as the original, constituent element.
It originally appears, rather, in the connection of the different communities with one another,
not in the relations between the different members of a single community. Further, although
money everywhere plays a role from very early on, it is nevertheless a predominant element, in
antiquity, only within the confines of certain one-sidedly developed nations, trading nations.
And even in the most advanced parts of the ancient world, among the Greeks and Romans, the
full development of money, which is presupposed in modern bourgeois society, appears only in
the period of their dissolution. This very simple category, then, makes a historic appearance in
its full intensity only in the most developed conditions of society. By no means does it wade its
way through all economic relations. For example, in the Roman Empire, at its highest point of
development, the foundation remained taxes and payments in kind. The money system actually
completely developed there only in the army. And it never took over the whole of labour. Thus,
although the simpler category may have existed historically before the more concrete, it can
achieve its full (intensive and extensive) development precisely in a combined form of society,
while the more concrete category was more fully developed in a less developed form of society.

Labour seems a quite simple category. The conception of labour in this general form - as labour
as such - is also immeasurably old. Nevertheless, when it is economically conceived in this


simplicity, ‘labour’ is as modern a category as are the relations which create this simple
abstraction. The Monetary Systemintro-f.htm - 19 for example, still locates wealth altogether
objectively, as an external thing, in money. Compared with this standpoint, the commercial, or
manufacture, system took a great step forward by locating the source of wealth not in the object
but in a subjective activity - in commercial and manufacturing activity - even though it still
always conceives this activity within narrow boundaries, as moneymaking. In contrast to this
system, that of the Physiocrats posits a certain kind of labour - agriculture - as the creator of
wealth, and the object itself no longer appears in a monetary disguise, but as the product in
general, as the general result of labour. This product, as befits the narrowness of the activity,
still always remains a naturally determined product - the product of agriculture, the product of
the earth par excellence.

It was an immense step forward for Adam Smith to throw out every limiting specification of
wealth-creating activity - not only manufacturing, or commercial or agricultural labour, but one
as well as the others, labour in general. With the abstract universality of wealth-creating activity
we now have the universality of the object defined as wealth, the product as such or again
labour as such, but labour as past, objectified labour. How difficult and great was this transition
may be seen from how Adam Smith himself from time to time still falls back into the
Physiocratic system. Now, it might seem that all that had been achieved thereby was to discover
the abstract expression for the simplest and most ancient relation in which human beings - in
whatever form of society - play the role of producers. This is correct in one respect. Not in
another. Indifference towards any specific kind of labour presupposes a very developed totality
of real kinds of labour, of which no single one is any longer predominant. As a rule, the most
general abstractions arise only in the midst of the richest possible concrete development, where
one thing appears as common to many, to all. Then it ceases to be thinkable in a particular form
alone. On the other side, this abstraction of labour as such is not merely the mental product of a
concrete totality of labours. Indifference towards specific labours corresponds to a form of
society in which individuals can with ease transfer from one labour to another, and where the
specific kind is a matter of chance for them, hence of indifference. Not only the category,
labour, but labour in reality has here become the means of creating wealth in general, and has
ceased to be organically linked with particular individuals in any specific form. Such a state of
affairs is at its most developed in the most modern form of existence of bourgeois society - in
the United States. Here, then, for the first time, the point of departure of modern economics,
namely the abstraction of the category ‘labour’, ‘labour as such’, labour pure and simple,
becomes true in practice. The simplest abstraction, then, which modern economics places at the
head of its discussions, and which expresses an immeasurably ancient relation valid in all forms
of society, nevertheless achieves practical truth as an abstraction only as a category of the most
modern society. One could say that this indifference towards particular kinds of labour, which is
a historic product in the United States, appears e.g. among the Russians as a spontaneous
inclination. But there is a devil of a difference between barbarians who are fit by nature to be
used for anything, and civilized people who apply themselves to everything. And then in
practice the Russian indifference to the specific character of labour corresponds to being
embedded by tradition within a very specific kind of labour, from which only external
influences can jar them loose.

This example of labour shows strikingly how even the most abstract categories, despite their
validity - precisely because of their abstractness - for all epochs, are nevertheless, in the specific
character of this abstraction, themselves likewise a product of historic relations, and possess
their full validity only for and within these relations.

Bourgeois society is the most developed and the most complex historic organization of
production. The categories which express its relations, the comprehension of its structure,
thereby also allows insights into the structure and the relations of production of all the vanished
social formations out of whose ruins and elements it built itself up, whose partly still
unconquered remnants are carried along within it, whose mere nuances have developed explicit
significance within it, etc. Human anatomy contains a key to the anatomy of the ape. The
intimations of higher development among the subordinate animal species, however, can be
understood only after the higher development is already known. The bourgeois economy thus
supplies the key to the ancient, etc. But not at all in the manner of those economists who


smudge over all historical differences and see bourgeois relations in all forms of society. One
can understand tribute, tithe, etc., if one is acquainted with ground rent. But one must not
identify them. Further, since bourgeois society is itself only a contradictory form of
development, relations derived from earlier forms will often be found within it only in an
entirely stunted form, or even travestied. For example, communal property. Although it is true,
therefore, that the categories of bourgeois economics possess a truth for all other forms of
society, this is to be taken only with a grain of salt. They can contain them in a developed, or
stunted, or caricatured form etc., but always with an essential difference. The so-called
historical presentation of development is founded, as a rule, on the fact that the latest form
regards the previous ones as steps leading up to itself, and, since it is only rarely and only under
quite specific conditions able to criticize itself - leaving aside, of course, the historical periods
which appear to themselves as times of decadence - it always conceives them one-sidedly. The
Christian religion was able to be of assistance in reaching an objective understanding of earlier
mythologies only when its own self-criticism had been accomplished to a certain degree, so to
speak, intro-f.htm - 13. Likewise, bourgeois economics arrived at an understanding of
feudal, ancient, oriental economics only after the self-criticism of bourgeois society had begun.
In so far as the bourgeois economy did not mythologically identify itself altogether with the
past, its critique of the previous economies, notably of feudalism, with which it was still
engaged in direct struggle, resembled the critique which Christianity levelled against paganism,
or also that of Protestantism against Catholicism.

In the succession of the economic categories, as in any other historical, social science, it must
not be forgotten that their subject - here, modern bourgeois society - is always what is given, in
the head as well as in reality, and that these categories therefore express the forms of being, the
characteristics of existence, and often only individual sides of this specific society, this subject,
and that therefore this society by no means begins only at the point where one can speak of it as
such; this holds for science as well. This is to be kept in mind because it will shortly be decisive
for the order and sequence of the categories. For example, nothing seems more natural than to
begin with ground rent, with landed property, since this is bound up with the earth, the source of
all production and of all being, and with the first form of production of all more or less settled
societies - agriculture. But nothing would be more erroneous. In all forms of society there is one
specific kind of production which predominates over the rest, whose relations thus assign rank
and influence to the others. It is a general illumination which bathes all the other colours and
modifies their particularity. It is a particular ether which determines the specific gravity of every
being which has materialized within it. For example, with pastoral peoples (mere hunting and
fishing peoples lie outside the point where real development begins). Certain forms of tillage
occur among them, sporadic ones. Landed property is determined by this. It is held in common,
and retains this form to a greater or lesser degree according to the greater or lesser degree of
attachment displayed by these peoples to their tradition, e.g. the communal property of the
Slavs. Among peoples with a settled agriculture - this settling already a great step - where this
predominates, as in antiquity and in the feudal order, even industry, together with its
organization and the forms of property corresponding to it, has a more or less landed-proprietary
character; is either completely dependent on it, as among the earlier Romans, or, as in the
Middle Ages, imitates, within the city and its relations, the organization of the land. In the
Middle Ages, capital itself - apart from pure money-capital - in the form of the traditional
artisans’ tools etc., has this landed-proprietary character. In bourgeois society it is the opposite.
Agriculture more and more becomes merely a branch of industry, and is entirely dominated by
capital. Ground rent likewise. In all forms where landed property rules, the natural relation still
predominant. In those where capital rules, the social, historically created element. Ground rent
cannot be understood without capital. But capital can certainly be understood without ground
rent. Capital is the all-dominating economic power of bourgeois society. It must form the
starting-point as well as the finishing-point, and must be dealt with before landed property.
After both have been examined in particular, their interrelation must be examined.

It would therefore be unfeasible and wrong to let the economic categories follow one another in
the same sequence as that in which they were historically decisive. Their sequence is
determined, rather, by their relation to one another in modern bourgeois society, which is
precisely the opposite of that which seems to be their natural order or which corresponds to
historical development. The point is not the historic position of the economic relations in the


succession of different forms of society. Even less is it their sequence ‘in the idea’ (Proudhon)
(a muddy notion of historic movement). Rather, their order within modern bourgeois society.

The purity (abstract specificity) in which the trading peoples - Phoenicians, Carthaginians -
appear in the old world is determined precisely by the predominance of the agricultural peoples.
Capital, as trading-capital or as money-capital, appears in this abstraction precisely where
capital is not yet the predominant element of societies. Lombards, Jews take up the same
position towards the agricultural societies of the Middle Ages.

As a further example of the divergent positions which the same category can occupy in different
social stages: one of the latest forms of bourgeois society, joint-stock companies. These also
appear, however, at its beginning, in the great, privileged monopoly trading companies.

The concept of national wealth creeps into the work of the economists of the seventeenth
century - continuing partly with those of the eighteenth - in the form of the notion that wealth is
created only to enrich the state, and that its power is proportionate to this wealth. This was the
still unconsciously hypocritical form in which wealth and the production of wealth proclaimed
themselves as the purpose of modern states, and regarded these states henceforth only as means
for the production of wealth.

The order obviously has to be (1) the general, abstract determinants which obtain in more or less
all forms of society, but in the above-explained sense. (2) The categories which make up the
inner structure of bourgeois society and on which the fundamental classes rest. Capital, wage
labour, landed property. Their interrelation. Town and country. The three great social classes.
Exchange between them. Circulation. Credit system (private). (3) Concentration of bourgeois
society in the form of the state. Viewed in relation to itself. The ‘unproductive’ classes. Taxes.
State debt. Public credit. The population. The colonies. Emigration. (4) The international
relation of production. International division of labour. International exchange. Export and
import. Rate of exchange. (5) The world market and crises.

### (4) Production. Means of Production and Relations of Production.

Relations of Production and Relations of Circulation. Forms of the

Notabene in regard to points to be mentioned here and not to be forgotten:

(1) War developed earlier than peace; the way in which certain economic relations such as wage
labour, machinery etc. develop earlier, owing to war and in the armies etc., than in the interior
of bourgeois society. The relation of productive force and relations of exchange also especially
vivid in the army.

(2) Relation of previous ideal historiography to the real. Namely of the so-called cultural
histories, which are only histories of religions and of states. (On that occasion something can
also be said about the various kinds of previous historiography. The so-called objective.
Subjective (moral among others). The philosophical.)

(3) Secondary and tertiary matters; in general, derivative, inherited, not original relations of
production. Influence here of international relations.

(4) Accusations about the materialism of this conception. Relation to naturalistic materialism.

(5) Dialectic of the concepts productive force (means of production) and relation of production,
a dialectic whose boundaries are to be determined, and which does not suspend the real
difference.

(6) The uneven development of material production relative to e.g. artistic development. In
general, the concept of progress not to be conceived in the usual abstractness. Modern art etc.
This disproportion not as important or so difficult to grasp as within practical-social relations
themselves. E.g. the relation of education. Relation of the United States to Europe. But the
really difficult point to discuss here is how relations of production develop unevenly as legal


relations. Thus e.g. the relation of Roman private law (this less the case with criminal and public
law) to modern production.

(7) This conception appears as necessary development. But legitimation of chance. How. (Of
freedom also, among other things.) (Influence of means of communication. World history has
not always existed; history as world history a result.)

(8) The point of departure obviously from the natural characteristic; subjectively and
objectively. Tribes, races etc.

(1) In the case of the arts, it is well known that certain periods of their flowering are out of all
proportion to the general development of society, hence also to the material foundation, the
skeletal structure as it were, of its organization. For example, the Greeks compared to the
moderns or also Shakespeare. It is even recognized that certain forms of art, e.g. the epic, can no
longer be produced in their world epoch-making, classical stature as soon as the production of
art, as such, begins; that is, that certain significant forms within the realm of the arts are possible
only at an undeveloped stage of artistic development. If this is the case with the relation
between different kinds of art within the realm of the arts, it is already less puzzling that it is the
case in the relation of the entire realm to the general development of society. The difficulty
consists only in the general formulation of these contradictions. As soon as they have been
specified, they are already clarified.

Let us take e.g. the relation of Greek art and then of Shakespeare to the present time. It is well
known that Greek mythology is not only the arsenal of Greek art but also its foundation. Is the
view of nature and of social relations on which the Greek imagination and hence Greek
[mythology] is based possible with self-acting mule spindles and railways and locomotives and
electrical telegraphs? What chance has Vulcan against Roberts and Co., Jupiter against the
lightning-rod and Hermes against the Credit Mobilier? All mythology overcomes and dominates
and shapes the forces of nature in the imagination and by the imagination; it therefore vanishes
with the advent of real mastery over them. What becomes of Fama alongside Printing House
Square? Greek art presupposes Greek mythology, i.e. nature and the social forms already
reworked in an unconsciously artistic way by the popular imagination. This is its material. Not
any mythology whatever, i.e. not an arbitrarily chosen unconsciously artistic reworking of
nature (here meaning everything objective, hence including society). Egyptian mythology could
never have been the foundation or the womb of Greek art. But, in any case, a mythology. Hence,
in no way a social development which excludes all mythological, all mythologizing relations to
nature; which therefore demands of the artist an imagination not dependent on mythology.

From another side: is Achilles possible with powder and lead? Or the Iliad with the printing
press, not to mention the printing machine? Do not the song and the saga and the muse
necessarily come to an end with the printer’s bar, hence do not the necessary conditions of epic
poetry vanish?

But the difficulty lies not in understanding that the Greek arts and epic are bound up with
certain forms of social development. The difficulty is that they still afford us artistic pleasure
and that in a certain respect they count as a norm and as an unattainable model.

A man cannot become a child again, or he becomes childish. But does he not find joy in the
child’s naïvité, and must he himself not strive to reproduce its truth at a higher stage? Does not
the true character of each epoch come alive in the nature of its children? Why should not the
historic childhood of humanity, its most beautiful unfolding, as a stage never to return, exercise
an eternal charm? There are unruly children and precocious children. Many of the old peoples
belong in this category. The Greeks were normal children. The charm of their art for us is not in
contradiction to the undeveloped stage of society on which it grew. [It] is its result, rather, and is
inextricably bound up, rather, with the fact that the unripe social conditions under which it
arose, and could alone arise, can never return.
