  	<h3 title="ch05">Tactics of the Class Struggle of the Proletariat</h3>
  
      <p>
  	  After examining, as early as 1844-45, one of the main shortcomings in
      the earlier materialism&#8212;namely, its inability to understand the
      conditions or appreciate the importance of practical revolutionary
      activity&#8212;Marx, along with his theoretical work, devoted unremitting
      attention, throughout his lifetime, to the tactical problems of the
      proletariat&#8217;s class struggle. An immense amount of material bearing
      on this is contained in <em>all</em> the works of Marx, particularly in the
      four volumes of his correspondence with Engels, published in 1913. This
  
  <!-- vol=21 pg=075 src=v21pp74h type= --> 
  
      material is still far from having been brought together, collected,
      examined and studied. We shall therefore have to confine ourselves here to
      the most general and brief remarks, emphasizing that Marx justly considered
      that, without <em>this</em> aspect, materialism is incomplete, onesided,
      and lifeless. The fundamental task of proletarian tactics was defined by
      Marx in strict conformity with all the postulates of his
      materialist-dialectical <em>Weltanschauung</em> [&#8220;world-view&#8221;]. 
	  Only an objective consideration of the sum total of the relations between 
	  absolutely all the classes in a given society, and consequently a consideration of the
      objective stage of development reached by that society and of the relations
      between it and other societies, can serve as a basis for the correct
      tactics of an advanced class. At the same time, all classes and all
      countries are regarded, not statically, but dynamically &#8212;i.e., not
      in a state of immobility&#8212;but in motion (whose laws are determined by
      the economic conditions of existence of each class). Motion, in its turn,
      is regarded from the standpoint, not only of the past, but also of the
      future, and that not in the vulgar sense it is understood in by the
      &#8220;evolutionists&#8221;, who see only slow changes, but dialectically: &#8220;...in
      developments of such magnitude 20 years are no more than a day,&#8220; Marx wrote
      to Engels, &#8220;thought later on there may come days in which 20 years are
      embodied&#8221; (<em>Briefwechsel</em>, Vol. 3,
  	  p. 127).<sup class="ednote"><a 
  	  name="bkV21E030" href="#fwV21E030">[2]</a></sup></p>
  	
  	  <p>
  	  At each stage of development, at each moment, proletarian tactics
      must take account of this objectively inevitable dialectics of human
      history, on the one hand, utilizing the periods of political stagnation or
      of sluggish, so-called &#8220;peaceful&#8221; development in order to develop the
      class-consciousness, strength and militancy of the advanced class, and, on
      the other hand, directing all the work of this utilization towards the
      &#8220;ultimate aim&#8221; of that class&#8217;s advance, towards creating in it the
      ability to find practical solutions for great tasks in the great days, in
      which &#8220;20 years are embodied&#8221;. Two of Marx&#8217;s arguments are of special
      importance in this connection: one of these is contained in <a
      href="../../../../marx/works/1847/poverty-philosophy/index.htm"><em>The
      Poverty of Philosophy</em></a>, and concerns the economic struggle and
      economic organizations of the proletariat; the other is contained in the
      <em><a
      href="../../../../marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/index.htm">Communist
      Manifesto</a></em> and concerns the asks of the proletariat. The former
      runs as follows:</p>

      <p class="quote">
	  &#8220;Large-scale industry concentrates in one place

<!-- vol=21 pg=076 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

	  a crowd of people unknown
      to one another. Competition divides their interests. But the maintenance
      of wages, this common interest which they have against their boss, unites
      them in a common thought of resistance&#8212;combination....
      Combinations, at first isolated, constitute themselves into groups ... and
      in face of always united capital, the maintenance of the association
      becomes more necessary to them [i.e., the workers] than that of wages....
      In this struggle&#8212;a veritable civil war&#8212;all the elements
      necessary for coming battle unite and develop. Once it has reached this
      point, association takes on a political character. (Marx, <a
      href="../../../../marx/works/1847/poverty-philosophy/index.htm"><em>The
      Poverty of Philosopy</em></a>, 1847)</p> 
	  
	  <p>
	  Here we have the programme and
      tactics of the economic struggle and of the trade union movement for
      several decades to come, for all the lengthy period in which the
      proletariat will prepare its forces for the &#8220;coming battle.&#8221; All this
      should be compared with numerous references by Marx and Engels to the
      example of the British labor movement, showing how industrial &#8220;property&#8221;
      leads to attempts &#8220;to buy the proletariat&#8221; (<em>Briefwechsel</em>, Vol. 1,
	  p. 136).<sup class="ednote"><a 
	  name="bkV21E031" href="#fwV21E031">[3]</a></sup> to divert them from the
      struggle; how this prosperity in general &#8220;demoralizes the workers&#8221; (Vol. 2, p. 218);
	  how the British proletariat becomes &#8220;bourgeoisified&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;this most bourgeois of all
      nations is apparently aiming ultimately at the possession of a bourgeois
      aristocracy and a bourgeois proletariat alongside the bourgeoisie&#8221; Chartists (1866; Vol. 3, p. 305)<sup class="ednote"><a 
	  name="bkV21E033" href="#fwV21E033">[4]</a></sup>; how the British workers&#8217; leaders
      are becoming a type midway between &#8220;a radical bourgeois and a worker&#8221; (in
      reference to Holyoak, Vol. 4, p. 209); how, owning to Britain&#8217;s
      monopoly, and as long as that monopoly lasts, &#8220;the British workingman will
      not budge&#8221; (Vol. 4, p. 433).<sup class="ednote"><a 
	  name="bkV21E034" href="#fwV21E034">[5]</a></sup> The tactics 
	  of the economic struggle, in connection with the
      general course (<em>and outcome</em>) of the working-class movement, are
      considered here from a remarkably broad, comprehensive, dialectical, and
      genuinely revolutionary standpoint.</p>

	  <p>
	  The <em>Communist Manifesto</em> advanced a fundamental Marxist
      principle on the tactics of the political struggle:</p>

      <p>
	  &#8220;The

<!-- vol=21 pg=077 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

	  Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the
      enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class; but in the
      movement of the present, they also represent and take care of the future
      of that movement.&#8221; That was why, in 1848, Marx supported the party of the
      &#8220;agrarian revolution&#8221; in Poland, &#8220;that party which brought about the
      Krakow insurrection in 1846.&#8221;<sup class="ednote"><a 
	  name="bkV21P077F01" href="#fwV21P077F01">[1]</a></sup></p>

	  <p>
	  In Germany, Marx, in 1848 and 1849, supported the
      extreme revolutionary democrats, and subsequently never retracted what he
      had then said about tactics. He regarded the German bourgeoisie as an
      element which was &#8220;inclined from the very beginning to betray the people&#8221;
      (only an alliance with the peasantry could have enabled the bourgeoisie to
      completely achieve its aims) &#8220;and compromise with the crowned
      representatives of the old society.&#8221; Here is Marx&#8217;s summing-up of
      the German bourgeois-democratic revolution&#8212;an analysis which,
      incidentally, is a sample of a materialism that examines society in
      motion, and, moreover, not only from the aspect of a motion that is
      <em>backward</em>:</p>

      <p class="quote">
	  &#8220;Without faith in itself, without faith in the people, grumbling at
      those above, trembling before those below ... intimidated by the world
      storm ... no energy in any respect, plagiarism in every respect ... without
      initiative ... an execrable old man who saw himself doomed to guide and
      deflect the first youthful impulses of a robust people in his own senile
      interests....&#8221; (<em>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em>, 1848; see
      <em>Literarischer Nachlass</em>, Vol. 3, p. 212.)<sup class="ednote"><a 
	  name="bkV21E035" href="#fwV21E035">[6]</a></sup></p>
      
	  <p>
	  About 20 years later, Marx declared, in a letter to Engels
      (<em>Briefwechsel</em>, Vol. 3, p.224), that the Revolution of 1848 had
      failed because the bourgeoisie had preferred peace with slavery to the mere
      prospect of a fight for freedom. When the revolutionary period of 1848-49
      ended, Marx opposed any attempt to play at revolution (his struggle against
      Schapper and Willich), and insisted on the ability to work in a new phase,
      which in a quasi-&#8220;peaceful&#8221; way was preparing new revolutions. The spirit
      in which Marx wanted this work to be conducted is to be seen in his
      appraisal of the situation in Germany in 1856, the darkest period of
      reaction: &#8220;The whole thing in Germany will depend on the possibility of
      backing the proletarian revolution by some second edition of the Peasant
      War&#8221; (<em>Briefwechsel</em>, Vol. 2,

<!-- vol=21 pg=078 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

	  p. 108).<sup class="ednote"><a 
	  name="bkV21E036" href="#fwV21E036">[7]</a></sup> While the democratic
      (bourgeois) revolution in Germany was uncompleted, Marx focused every
      attention, in the tactics of the socialist proletariat, on developing the
      democratic energy of the peasantry. He held that Lassalle&#8217;s attitude
      was &#8220;objectively... a betrayal of the whole workers&#8217; movement to
      Prussia&#8221; (Vol. 3, p.210), incidentally because Lassalle was tolerant of the
      Junkers and Prussian nationalism.</p>

      <p>
	  &#8220;In a predominantly agricultural country,&#8221; Engels wrote in 1865, in
      exchanging views with Marx on their forthcoming joint declaration in the
      press, &#8220;...it is dastardly to make an exclusive attack on the bourgeoisie
      in the name of the industrial proletariat but never to devote a word to the
      patriarchal exploitation of the rural proletariat under the lash of the
      great feudal aristocracy&#8221; (Vol. 3, p. 217).<sup class="ednote"><a 
	  name="bkV21E037" href="#fwV21E037">[8]</a></sup></p>

      <p>
	  From 1864 to 1870, when the period of the consummation of the
      bourgeois-democratic revolution in Germany was coming to an end, a period
      in which the Prussian and Austrian exploiting classes were struggling to
      complete that revolution in one way or another <em>from above</em>, Marx
      not only rebuked Lassalle, who was coquetting with Bismarck, but also
      corrected Liebknecht, who had &#8220;lapsed into Austrophilism&#8221; and a defense of
      particularism; Marx demanded revolutionary tactics which would combat with
      equal ruthlessness both Bismarck and the Austrophiles, tactics which would
      not be adapted to the &#8220;victor&#8221;&#8212;the Prussian Junkers&#8212;but would
      immediately renew the revolutionary struggle against him <em>despite the
	  conditions</em> created by the Prussian military victories
      (<em>Briefwechsel</em>, Vol. 3, pp. 134, 136, 147, 179, 204, 210, 215, 418,
      437, 440-41).</p>

      <p>
	  In the celebrated Address of the International of September 9
      1870, Marx warned the French proletariat against an untimely uprising, but
      when an uprising nevertheless took place (1871), Marx enthusiastically
      hailed the revolutionary initiative of the masses, who were &#8220;storming
      heaven&#8221; (Marx&#8217;s <a 
	  href="../../../../marx/works/1871/letters/71_04_17.htm">letter to Kugelmann</a>).</p>

      <p>
	  From the standpoint of Marx&#8217;s dialectical materialism, the defeat of
      revolutionary action in that situation, as in many other, was a lesser
      evil, in the general course <em>and outcome</em> of the proletarian
      struggle, than the abandonment of a position already occupied, than
      surrender without battle. Such a surrender would have demoralised the
      proletariat and weakened its militancy. While fully appreciating the use

<!-- vol=21 pg=079 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

      of legal means of struggle during periods of political stagnation and the
      domination of bourgeois legality, Marx, in 1877 and 1878, following the
      passage of the Anti-Socialist Law,<sup class="ednote"><a 
	  name="bkV21E038" href="#fwV21E038">[9]</a></sup>
      sharply condemned Most&#8217;s &#8220;revolutionary phrases&#8221;; no less sharply, if not
      more so, did he attack the opportunism that had for a time come over the
      official Social-Democratic Party, which did not at once display
      resoluteness, firmness, revolutionary spirit and the readiness to resort
      to an illegal struggle in response to the Anti-Socialist Law
      (<em>Briefwechsel</em>, Vol. 4, pp. 397, 404, 418, 422, 424; cf. also
      letters to Sorge).</p>

     feudal services and promising to give the peasants lands without
