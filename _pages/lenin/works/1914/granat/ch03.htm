      <p class="quote">
  	  &#8220;It is the ultimate aim of this work to lay bare the
      economic law of motion of modern society, i.e., capitalist, bourgeois
      society,&#8221;</p>
	  
	  <p class="fst">
	  says Marx in the preface to <em><a
      href="../../../../marx/works/1867-c1/index.htm">Capital</a></em>. An
      investigation into the relations of production in a given, historically
      defined society, in their inception, development, and decline&#8212;such
      is the content of Marx&#8217;s economic doctrine. In capitalist society,
      the production of <em>commodities</em> is predominant, and Marx&#8217;s
      analysis therefore begins with an analysis of commodity.</p>
  
  	  <h4>Value</h4>
  
      <p>
	  <a id="s1.1" name="s1.1"></a>
	  A commodity is, in the first place, a thing that satisfies a human want;
      in the second place, it is a thing that can be exchanged for another
      thing. The utility of a thing makes is <em>use-value</em>. Exchange-value
      (or, simply, value), is first of all the ratio, the proportion, in which a
      certain number of use-values of one kind can be exchanged for a certain
      number of

<!-- vol=21 pg=060 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

      use-values of another kind. Daily experience shows us that million upon
      millions of such exchanges are constantly equating with one another every
      kind of use-value, even the most diverse and incomparable. Now, what is
      there in common between these various things, things constantly equated
      with one another in a definite system of social relations? Their common
      feature is that they are <em>products of labor</em>. In exchanging
      products, people equate the most diverse kinds of labor. The production of
      commodities is a system of social relations in which individual producers
      create diverse products (the social division of labor), and in which all
      these products are equated with one another in the process of
      exchange. Consequently, what is common to all commodities is not the
      concrete labor of a definite branch of production, not labor of one
      particular kind, but <em>abstract</em> human labor&#8212;human labor in
      general. All the labor power of a given society, as represented in the sum
      total of the values of all commodities, is one and the same human labor
      power. Thousands upon thousands of millions of acts of exchange prove
      this. Consequently, each particular commodity represents only a certain
      share of the <em>socially necessary</em> labor time. The magnitude of
      value is determined by the amount of socially necessary labor, or by the
      labor time that is socially necessary for the production of a given
      commodity, of a given use-value.</p>
	  
	  <p>
      &#8220;Whenever, by an exchange, we equate as values our different
      products, by that very act, we also equate, as human labor, the different
      kind of labor expended upon them. We are not aware of this, nevertheless
      we do it.&#8221; [<em><a
      href="../../../../marx/works/1867-c1/index.htm">Capital</a></em>]. As
      one of the earlier economists said, value is a relation between two
      persons; only he should have added: a relation concealed beneath a
      material wrapping. We can understand what value is only when we consider
      it from the standpoint of the system of social relations of production in
      a particular historical type of society, moreover, or relations that
      manifest themselves in the mass phenomenon of exchange, a phenomenon which
      repeats itself thousands upon thousands of time. &#8220;As values, all
      commodities are only definite masses of congealed labor time.&#8221;
      [<em><a
      href="../../../../marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/index.htm">A
      Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</a></em>].</p>

      <p>
	  After making a detailed analysis of the twofold character of the labor
      incorporated in commodities, Marx goes on to analyze the <em>form of

<!-- vol=21 pg=061 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

	  value</em> and <em>money</em>. Here, Marx&#8217;s main task is to study the
      <em>origin</em> of the money form of value, to study the <em>historical
	  process</em> of the development of exchange, beginning with individual and
      incidental acts of exchange (the &#8220;elementary or accidental form of
      value&#8221;, in which a given quantity of one commmodity is exchanged for a given
      quantity of another), passing on to the universal form of value, in which a
      number of different commodities are exchanged for one and the same
      particular commodity, and ending with the money form of value, when gold
      becomes that particular commodity, the universal equivalent. As the highest
      product of the development of exchange and commodity production, money
      masks, conceals, the social character of all individual labor, the social
      link between individual producers united by the market. Marx analyzes the
      various functions of money in very great detail; it is important to note
      here in particular (as in the opening chapters of <em>Capital</em> in
      general) that what seems to be an abstract and at times purely deductive
      mode of exposition deals in reality with a gigantic collection of factual
      material on the history of the development of exchange and commodity
      production.</p>

	  <p class="quote">
      &#8220;If we consider money, its existence implies a definite stage in the
      exchange of commodities. The particular functions of money, which it
      performs either as the mere equivalent of commodities or as means of
      circulation, or means of payment, as hoard or as universal money, point,
      according to the extent and relative preponderance of the one function or
      the other, to very different stages in the process of social
      production.&#8221; [<em><a
      href="../../../../marx/works/1867-c1/index.htm">Capital</a></em>].</p>

	  <h4>Surplus Value</h4>

      <p>
  	  <a id="s2.1" name="s2.1"></a>
  	  At a certain stage in the development of commodity production money
      becomes transformed into capital. The formula of commodity circulation was
      C-M-C (commodity&#8212;money&#8212;commodity)&#8212;i.e., the sale of one
      commodity for the purpose of buying another.</p>
	  
	  <p>
      The general formula of capital, on the contrary, is M-C-M&#8212;i.e., the
      purchase for the purpose of selling (at a profit).</p>

	  <p>
      The increase over the original value of the money that is put into
      circulation is called by Marx surplus value. The fact of this

<!-- vol=21 pg=062 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

      &#8220;growth&#8221; of money in capitalist circulation is common
      knowledge. Indeed, it is this &#8220;growth&#8221; which transforms money
      into <em>capital</em>, as a special and historically determined social
      relation of production. Surplus value cannot arise out of commodity
      circulation, for the latter knows only the exchange of equivalents;
      neither can it arise out of price increases, for the mutual losses and
      gains of buyers and sellers would equalize one another, whereas what we
      have here in not an individual phenomenon but a mass, average and social
      phenomenon. To obtain surplus value, the owner of money &#8220;must
      ... find... in the market a commodity, whose use-value possesses the
      peculiar property of being a source of value&#8221; [<em><a
      href="../../../../marx/works/1867-c1/index.htm">Capital</a></em>]&#8212;a
      commodity whose process of consumption is at the same time a process of
      the creation of value. Such a commodity exists&#8212;human labor
      power. Its consumption is labor, and labor creates value. The owner of
      money buys labor power at its value, which, like the value of every other
      commodity, is determined by the socially necessary labor time requisite
      for its production (i.e., the cost of maintaining the worker and his
      family). Having bought enough labor power, the owner of money is entitled
      to use it, that is, to set it to work for a whole day&#8212;12 hours, let
      us say. Yet, in the course of six hours (&#8220;necessary&#8221; labor
      time) the worker creates product sufficient to cover the cost of his own
      maintenance; in the course of the next six hours (&#8220;surplus&#8221;
      labor time), he creates &#8220;surplus&#8221; product, or surplus value,
      for which the capitalist does not pay. Therefore, from the standpoint of
      the process of production, two parts must be distinguished in capital:
      constant capital, which is expended on means of production (machinery,
      tools, raw materials, etc.), whose value, without any change, is
      transferred (immediately or part by part) to the finished product;
      secondly, variable capital, which is expended on labor power. The value of
      this latter capital is not invariable, but grows in the labor process,
      creating surplus value. Therefore, to express the degree of
      capital&#8217;s exploitation of labor power, surplus must be compared not
      with the entire capital but only with variable capital. Thus, in the
      example just given, the rate of surplus value, as Marx calls this ratio,
      will be 6:6, i.e., 100 per cent.</p>

<!-- vol=21 pg=063 src=v21pp74h type= -->

      <p>
      There were two historical prerequisites for capital to arise: first, the
      accumulation of certain sums of money in the hands of individuals under
      conditions of a relatively high level of development of commodity
      production in general; secondly, the existence of a worker who is
      &#8220;free&#8221; in a double sense: free of all constraint or
      restriction on the scale of his labor power, and free from the land and
      all means of production in general, a free and unattached laborer, a
      &#8220;proletarian&#8221;, who cannot subsist except by selling his labor
      power.</p>

  	  <p>
      There are two main ways of increasing surplus value: lengthening the
      working day (&#8220;absolute surplus value&#8221;), and reducing the
      necessary working day (&#8220;relative surplus value&#8221;). In analyzing
      the former, Marx gives a most impressive picture of the struggle of the
      working class for a shorter working day and of interference by the state
      authority to lengthen the working day (from the 14th century to the 17th)
      and to reduce it (factory legislation in the 19th century). Since the
      appearance of <em>Capital</em>, the history of the working class movement in
      all civilized countries of the world has provided a wealth of new facts
      amplifying this picture.</p>

	  <p>
	  Analyzing the production of relative surplus value, Marx investigates the
      three fundamental historical stages in capitalism&#8217;s increase of the
      productivity of labor: (1) simple co-operation; (2) the division of labor,
      and manufacture; (3) machinery and large-scale industry. How profoundly Marx
      has here revealed the basic and typical features of capitalist development
      is shown incidentally by the fact that investigations into the handicraft
      industries in Russia furnish abundant material illustrating the first two of
      the mentioned stages. The revolutionizing effect of large-scale machine
      industry, as described by Marx in 1867, has revealed itself in a number of
      &#8220;new&#8221; countries (Russia, Japan, etc.), in the course of the
      half-century that has since elapsed.</p>

	  <p>
 	  To continue. New and important in the highest degree is Marx&#8217;s
      analysis of the <em>accumulation of capital</em>&#8212;i.e., the
      transformation of a part of surplus value into capital, and its use, not for
      satisfying the personal needs of whims of the capitalist, but for new
      production. Marx revealed the error made by all earlier classical political
      economists (beginning with Adam Smith), who assumed that the entire surplus

<!-- vol=21 pg=064 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

      value which is transformed into capital goes to form variable capital. In
      actual fact, it is divided into <em>means of production</em> and variable
      capital. Of tremendous importance to the process of development of
      capitalism and its transformation into socialism is the more rapid growth of
      the constant capital share (of the total capital) as compared with the
      variable capital share.</p>

	  <p>
 	  By speeding up the supplanting of workers by machinery and by creating
      wealth at one extreme and poverty at the other, the accumulation of capital
      also gives rise to what is called the &#8220;reserve army of labor&#8221;,
      to the &#8220;relative surplus&#8221; of workers, or &#8220;capitalist
      overpopulation&#8221;, which assumes the most diverse forms and enables
      capital to expand production extremely rapidly. In conjunction with credit
      facilities and the accumulation of capital in the form of means of
      production, this incidentally is the key to an understanding of the
      <em>crises</em> of overproduction which occur periodically in capitalist
      countries&#8212;at first at an average of every 10 years, and later at more
      lengthy and less definite intervals. From the accumulation of capital under
      capitalism we should distinguish what is known as primitive accumulation:
      the forcible divorcement of the worker from the means of production, the
      driving of the peasant off the land, the stealing of communal lands, the
      system of colonies and national debts, protective tariffs, and the
      like. &#8220;Primitive accumulation&#8221; creates the &#8220;free&#8221;
      proletarian at one extreme, and the owner of money, the capitalist, at the
      other.</p>

	  <p>
	  The <strong>&#8220;historical tendency of capitalist accumulation&#8221;</strong>
	  is described by Marx in the following celebrated words:</p>

      <p class="quote">
	  &#8220;The expropriation of the immediate producers is accomplished with
      merciless vandalism, and under the stimulus of passions the most infamous,
      the most sordid, the pettiest, the most meanly odious. Self-earned private
      property [of the peasant and handicraftsman], that is based, so to say, on
      the fusing together of the isolated, independent laboring-individual with
      the conditions of his labor, is supplanted by capitalistic private
      property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labor of
      others.... That which is now to be expropriated is no longer the laborer
      working for himself,

<!-- vol=21 pg=065 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

	  but the capitalist exploiting many laborers. This
      expropriation is accomplished by the action of the immanent laws of
      capitalistic production itself, by the centralization of capital. One
      capitalist always kills many. Hand in hand with this centralization, or
      this expropriation of many capitalists by few, develop, on an ever
      extending scale, the co-operative form of the labor process, the conscious
      technical application of science, the methodical cultivation of the soil,
      the transformation of the instruments of labor into instruments of labor
      only usable in common, the economizing of all means of production by their
      use as the means of production of combined, socialized labor, the
      entanglement of all people in the net of the world market, and with this
      the international character of the capitalistic regime. Along with the
      constantly diminishing number of the magnates of capital, who usurp and
      monopolize all advantages of this process of transformation, grows the
      mass of misery, oppression, slavery, degradation, exploitation; but with
      this too grows the revolt of the working class, a class always increasing
      in numbers, and disciplined, united, organized by the very mechanism of
      the process of capitalist production itself. The monopoly of capital
      becomes a fetter upon the mode of production, which has sprung up and
      flourished along with, and under, it. Centralization of the means of
      production and socialization of labor at last reach a point where they
      become incompatible with their capitalist integument. The integument is
      burst asunder. The knell of capitalist private property sound. The
      expropriators are expropriated.&#8221; (<em>Capital</em>, Volume I)</p>

	  <p>
	  Also new and important in the highest degree is the analysis Marx gives,
      in Volume Two of <em>Capital</em> of the reproduction of aggregate social
      capital. Here, too, Marx deals, not with an individual phenomenon but with a
      mass phenomenon; not with a fractional part of the economy of society, but
      with that economy as a whole. Correcting the aforementioned error of the
      classical economists, Marx divides the whole of social production into two
      big sections: (I) production of the means of production, and (II) production
      of articles of consumption, and examines in detail, with numerical examples,
      the circulation of the aggregate social capital&#8212;both when reproduced
      in its former dimension and in the case of accumulation. Volume Three of

<!-- vol=21 pg=066 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

	  <em>Capital</em> solves the problem of how the <em>average rate of
      profit</em> is formed on the basis of the law of value. This immense stride
      forward made by economic science in the person of Marx consists in his
      having conducted an analysis, from the standpoint of mass economic
      phenomena, of the social economy as a whole, not from the standpoint of
      individual cases or of the external and superficial aspects of competition,
      to which vulgar political economy and the modern &#8220;theory of marginal
      utility&#8221;<sup class="ednote"><a name="bkV21P066F01"
      href="#fwV21P066F01">[1]</a></sup> frequently restrict
      themselves. Marx first analyzes the origin of surplus value, and then goes
      on to consider its division into profit, interest, and ground rent. Profit
      is the ratio between surplus value and the total capital invested in an
      undertaking. Capital with a &#8220;high organic composition&#8221; (i.e.,
      with a preponderance of constant capital over variable capital in excess of
      the social average) yields a rate of profit below the average; capital with
      a &#8220;low organic composition&#8221; yields a rate of profit above the
      average. Competition among capitalists, and their freedom to transfer their
      capital from one branch to another, will in both cases reduce the rate of
      profit to the average. The sum total of the values of all the commodities in
      a given society coincides with the sum total of the prices of the
      commodities, but, in individual undertakings and branches of production, as
      a result of competition, commodities are sold not at their values at the
      <em>prices of production</em> (or production prices), which are equal to the
      capital expended plus the average profit.</p>

	  <p>
	  In this way, the well-known and indisputable fact of the divergence
      between prices and values and of the equalization of profits is fully
      explained by Marx on the basis of law of value, since the sum total of
      values of all commodities coincides with the sum total of prices. However,
      the equating of (social) value to (individual) prices does not take place
      simply and directly, but in a very complex way. It is quite natural that in
      a society of separate producers of commodities, who are united only by the
      market, a conformity to law can be only an average, social, mass
      manifestation, with individual deviations in either direction mutually
      compensating one another.</p>

	  <p>
	  A rise in the productivity of labor implies a more rapid growth of
	  constant capital as compared with variable capital. Inasmuch as surplus

<!-- vol=21 pg=067 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

      value is a function of variable capital alone, it is obvious that the rate
      of profit (the ratio of surplus value to the whole capital, not to its
      variable part alone) tends to fall. Marx makes a detailed analysis of this
      tendency and of a number of circumstances that conceal or counteract
      it. Without pausing to deal with the extremely interesting sections of
      Volume Three of <em>Capital</em>, Vol. I devoted to usurer&#8217;s capital,
      commercial capital and money capital, we must pass on to the most important
      section&#8212;the theory of <em>ground rent</em>. Since the area of land is
      limited and, in capitalist countries, the land is all held by individual
      private owners, the price of production of agricultural products is
      determined by the cost of production, not on soil of average quality but on
      the worst soil; not under average conditions but under the worst conditions
      of delivery of produce to the market. The difference between this price and
      the price of production on better soil (or in better conditions) constitutes
      <em>differential</em> rent. Analyzing this in detail, and showing how it
      arises out of the difference in fertility of different plots of land, and
      out of the difference in the amount of capital invested in land, Marx fully
      reveals (see also <em>Theories of Surplus Value</em>, in which the criticism
      of Rodbertus is most noteworthy) the error of Ricardo, who considered that
      differential rent is derived only when there is a successive transition from
      better land to worse. On the contrary, there may be inverse transitions,
      land may pass from one category into others (owing to advances in
      agricultural techniques, the growth of towns, and so on), and the notorious
      &#8220;law of diminishing returns&#8221;, which charges Nature with the
      defects, limitations and contradictions of capitalism, is profoundly
      erroneous. Further, the equalisation of profit in all branches of industry
      and the national economy in general presupposes complete freedom of
      competition and the free flow of capital from one branch to
      another. However, the private ownership of land creates monopoly, which
      hinders that free flow. Because of that monopoly, the products of
      agriculture, where a lower organic composition of capital obtains, and
      consequently an individually higher rate of profit, do not enter into the
      quite free process of the equalisation of the rate of profit. As a
      monopolist, the landowner can keep the price above the average, and this

<!-- vol=21 pg=068 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

	  monopoly price gives rise to absolute rent. Differential rent cannot be done
      away with under capitalism, but absolute rent can&#8212;for instance, by
      the nationalisation of the land, by making it state property. That would
      undermine the monopoly of private landowners, and would mean the sole
      consistent and full operation of freedom of competition in agriculture. That
      is why, as Marx points out, bourgeois radicals have again and again in the
      course of history advanced this progressive bourgeois demand for
      nationalisation of the land, a demand which, however, frightens most
      of the bourgeoisie, because it would too closely affect another monopoly,
      one that is particularly important and &#8220;sensitive&#8221;
      today&#8212;the monopoly of the means of production in general. (A
      remarkably popular, concise, and clear exposition of his theory of the
      average rate of profit on capital and of absolute ground rent is given by
      Marx himself in a <a href="../../../../marx/works/1862/letters/62_08_02.htm">letter 
	  to Engels</a>, dated August 2, 1862. See Briefwechsel,
      Volume 3, pp. 77-81; also the letter of August 9, 1862, ibid.,
      pp. 86-87.)</p>

      <p>
   	  With reference to the history of ground rent it is also important to note
      Marx&#8217;s analysis showing how labor rent (the peasant creates surplus
      product by working on the lord&#8217;s land) is transformed into rent paid
      in produce or in kind (the peasant creates surplus product by working on the
      lord&#8217;s land) is transformed into rent paid in produce or in kind (the
      peasant creates surplus product on his own land and hands it over to the
      landlord because of &#8220;non-economic constraint&#8221;), then into
      money-rent (rent in kind, which is converted into money&#8212;the
      <em>obrok</em><sup class="ednote"><a name="bkV21P068F01"
	  href="#fwV21P068F01">[2]</a></sup> of old Russia&#8212;as
	  a result of the development of commodity production), and finally into 
	  capitalist rent, when
      the peasant is replaced by the agricultural <em>entrepreneur</em>, who
      cultivates the soil with the help of hired labor. In connection with this
      analysis of the &#8220;genesis of capitalistic ground rent&#8221;, note
      should be taken of a number of profound ideas (of particular importance to
      backward countries like Russia) expressed by Marx regarding the
      <em>evolution of capitalism in agriculture</em>:</p>

	  &#8220;The transformation of rent in kind into money-rent is furthermore
      not only inevitably accompanied, but even anticipated, by the formation of
      a class of propertyless day-laborers, who hire themselves out for
      money. During their genesis, when this new class appears but sporadically,

	  the custom necessarily develops among the more prosperous peasants,
      subject to rent payments, of exploiting agricultural wage-laborers for
      their own account, much as in feudal times, when the more well-to-do
      peasant serfs themselves also held serfs. In this way, they gradually
      acquire the possibility of accumulating a certain amount of wealth and
      themselves becoming transformed into future capitalists. The old
      self-employed possessors of land themselves just give rise to a nursery
      school for capitalist tenants, whose development is conditioned by the
      general development of capitalist production beyond the bounds of the
      countryside.&#8221; [<a

      &#8220;The expropriation and eviction of a part of the agricultural
      population not only set free for industrial capital the laborers, their
      means of subsistence, and material for labor; it also created the home
      market.&#8221; (<em>Capital</em>, Vol. I) In their turn, the impoverishment
      and ruin of the rural population play a part in the creation, for capital,
      or a reserve army of labor. In every capitalist country
      &#8220;part of the agricultural population is therefore constantly on the
      point of passing over into an urban or manufacturing [i.e.,
      non-agricultural] proletariat.... This source of relative surplus
      population is thus constantly flowing.... The agricultural laborer is
      therefore reduced to the minimum of wages, and always stands with one foot
      already in the swamp of pauperism.&#8221; (<em>Capital</em>, Vol. I) The
      peasant&#8217;s private ownership of the land he tills is the foundation
      of small-scale production and the condition for its prospering and
      achieving the classical form. But such small-scale production is
      compatible only with a narrow and primitive framework of production and
      society. Under capitalism, the</p>

      mortgages and usury; the capitalist class exploits the peasant class
      through the state taxes.&#8221; [<a

	  &#8220;The small holding of the peasant is now only the pretext that
      allows the capitalist to draw profits, interest and rent from the soil,
      while leaving it to the tiller of the soil himself to see how he can
      extract his wages.&#8221; (<em>The Eighteenth Brumaire</em>) As a rule,
      the peasant cedes to capitalist society&#8212;i.e., to the

      What is &#8220;one of the reasons why grain prices are lower in countries
      with predominant small-peasant land proprietorship than in countries with
      a capitalist mode of production?&#8221; [<a
      href="../../../../marx/works/1894-c3/index.htm"><em>Capital</em></a>,
      Vol. III] It is that the peasant hands over gratis to society (i.e., the
      capitalist class) a part of his surplus product. &#8220;This lower price
      [of grain and other agricultural produce] is consequently a result of the
      producers&#8217; poverty and by no means of their labor
      productivity.&#8221; [<a

	  &#8220;Proprietorship of land parcels, by its very nature, excludes the
      development of social productive forces of labor, social forms of labor,
      social concentration of capital, large-scale cattle raising, and the
      progressive application of science. Usury and a taxation system must
      impoverish it everywhere. The expenditure of capital in the price of the
      land withdraws this capital from cultivation. An infinite fragmentation of

      (Co-operative societies, i.e., associations of small peasants, while

      little&#8212;next to nothing&#8212;for the mass of poor peasants; then the
