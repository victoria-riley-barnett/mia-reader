      <p>
      Marx, Karl, was born on May 5, 1818 (New Style), in the city of Trier
      (Rhenish Prussia). His father was a lawyer, a Jew, who in 1824 adopted
      Protestantism. The family was well-to-do, cultured, but not
      revolutionary. After graduating from a <em>Gymnasium</em> in Trier, Marx
      entered the university, first at Bonn and later in Berlin, where he read
      law, majoring in history and philosophy. He concluded his university
      course in 1841, submitting a doctoral thesis on the philosophy of
      Epicurus. At the time Marx was a Hegelian idealist in his views. In
      Berlin, he belonged to the circle of &#8220;Left Hegelians&#8221;
  	  (Bruno Bauer and others) who sought to draw atheistic and revolutionary 
  	  conclusion from Hegel&#8217;s philosophy.</p>

  	  <p>
  	  After graduating, Marx moved to Bonn, hoping to become a
      professor. However, the reactionary policy of the government, which deprived
      Ludwig Feuerbach of his chair in 1832, refused to allow him to return to the
      university in 1836, and in 1841 forbade young Professor Bruno Bauer to
      lecture at Bonn, made Marx abandon the idea of an academic career. Left
      Hegelian views were making rapid headway in Germany at the time. Feuerbach
      began to criticize theology, particularly after 1836, and turn to
      materialism, which in 1841 gained ascendancy in his philosophy (<em>The
      Essence of Christianity</em>). The year 1843 saw the appearance of his 
  	  <em>Principles of the Philosophy of the Future</em>. &#8220;One must oneself 
  	  have experienced the
      liberating effect&#8221; of these books, Engels subsequently wrote of
      these works of Feuerbach. &#8220;We [i.e., the Left Hegelians, including
      Marx] all became at once Feuerbachians.&#8221; At that time, some radical
      bourgeois in the Rhineland, who were in touch with the Left Hegelians,
      founded, in Cologne, an opposition paper called <em>Rheinische
      Zeitung</em> (The first issue appeared on January 1, 1842). Marx

<!-- vol=21 pg=047 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

	  and Bruno Bauer were invited to be the chief contributors, and
      in October 1842 Marx became editor-in-chief and moved from Bonn to
      Cologne. The newspaper&#8217;s revolutionary-democratic trend became more and more
      pronounced under Marx&#8217;s editorship, and the government first imposed
      double and triple censorship on the paper, and then on January 1 1843
      decided to suppress it. Marx had to resign the editorship before that
      date, but his resignation did not save the paper, which suspended
      publication in March 1843. Of the major articles Marx contributed to
      <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em>, Engels notes, in addition to those indicated
      below (see <em>Bibliography</em>),<sup class="ednote"><a 
	  name="bkV21P047F01" href="#fwV21P047F01">[1]</a></sup>
	  an article on the condition of peasant winegrowers in the Moselle
	  Valley.<sup class="ednote"><a name="bkV21P047F02"
	  href="#fwV21P047F02">[2]</a></sup> Marx&#8217;s 
	  journalistic activities convinced him that he was insufficiently acquainted 
	  with political economy, and he zealously set out to study it.</p>

	  <p>
	  In 1843, Marx married, at Kreuznach, a childhood friend he had become
      engaged to while still a student. His wife came of a reactionary family of
      the Prussian nobility, her elder brother being Prussia&#8217;s Minister of
      the Interior during a most reactionary period&#8212;1850-58. In the autumn
      of 1843, Marx went to Paris in order to publish a radical journal abroad,
      together with Arnold Ruge (1802-1880); Left Hegelian; in prison in
      1825-30; a political exile following 1848, and a Bismarckian after
      1866-70). Only one issue of this journal, <em>Deutsch-Franz&#246;sische
      Jahrb&#252;cher</em>, appeared;<sup class="ednote"><a
	 name="bkV21P047F03" href="#fwV21P047F03" 
	>[3]</a></sup> publication was discontinued owing to 
	  the difficulty of secretly distributing it in Germany, and to disagreement
	  with Ruge. Marx&#8217;s articles in this journal showed that he was
      already a revolutionary who advocated &#8220;merciless criticism of
      everything existing&#8221;, and in particular the &#8220;criticism by
	  weapon&#8221;,<sup class="ednote"><a
	  name="bkV21E029" href="#fwV21E029">[13]</a></sup> and appealed to the 
	  <em>masses</em> and to the <em>proletariat</em>.</p>

    <p>
      In September 1844, Frederick Engels came to Paris for a few days, and from
      that time on became Marx&#8217;s closest friend. They both took a most
      active part in the then seething life of the revolutionary groups in Paris
      (of particular importance at the time was Proudhon&#8217;s<sup class="ednote"><a
 	 name="bkV21P047F04" href="#fwV21P047F04">[4]</a></sup> doctrine), which Marx pulled to pieces 
	  in his <em><a href="../../../../marx/works/1847/poverty-philosophy/index.htm">Poverty
      of Philosophy</a></em>, 1847); waging a vigorous struggle against the
      various doctrines of petty-bourgeois socialism, they worked out the theory
      and tactics of revolutionary <em>proletarian socialism</em>, or communism

<!-- vol=21 pg=048 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

	  Marxism). See Marx&#8217;s works of this period, 1844-48 in the
      <em>Bibliography</em>. At the insistent request of the Prussian
      government, Marx was banished from Paris in 1845, as a dangerous
      revolutionary. He went to Brussels. In the spring of 1847 Marx and Engels
      joined a secret propaganda society called the Communist League;<sup 
	  class="ednote"><a name="bkV21P048F01"
	  href="#fwV21P048F01">[5]</a></sup> they took a
      prominent part in the League&#8217;s Second Congress (London, November
      1847), at whose request they drew up the celebrated <em><a
      href="../../../../marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/index.htm">Communist
      Manifesto</a></em>, which appeared in February 1848. With the clarity and
      brilliance of genius, this work outlines a new world-conception,
      consistent with materialism, which also embrace the realm of social life;
      dialectics, as the most comprehensive and profound doctrine of
      development; the theory of the class struggle and of the world-historic
      revolutionary role of the proletariat&#8212;the creator of a new,
      communist society.</p>

	  <p>On the outbreak of the Revolution of February 1848,<sup class="ednote"><a
	 name="bkV21P048F02" href="#fwV21P048F02">[6]</a></sup> Marx was banished from Belgium. 
	  He returned to Paris, whence, after the March Revolution,<sup class="ednote"><a
	 name="bkV21P048F03" href="#fwV21P048F03">[7]</a></sup> he went to Cologne, Germany, where 
	  <em>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em><sup class="ednote"><a
	 name="bkV21P048F04" href="#fwV21P048F04">[8]</a></sup> was published
      from June 1, 1848, to May 19, 1849, with Marx as editor-in-chief. The new
      theory was splendidly confirmed by the course of the revolutionary events of
      1848-49, just as it has been subsequently confirmed by all proletarian and
      democratic movements in all countries of the world. The victorious
      counter-revolution first instigated court proceedings against Marx (he was
      acquitted on February 9, 1849), and then banished him from Germany (May 16,
      1849). First Marx went to Paris, was again banished after the demonstration
      of June 13, 1849,<sup class="ednote"><a name="bkV21P048F05"
  	  href="#fwV21P048F05">[9]</a></sup> and then went to London, 
  	  where he lived until his death.</p>
  
  	  <p>
  	  His life as a political exile was a very hard one, as the correspondence
      between Marx and Engels (published in 1913) clearly reveals. Poverty weighed
      heavily on Marx and his family; had it not been for Engels&#8217; constant
      and selfless financial aid, Marx would not only have been unable to complete
      <em><a href="../../../../marx/works/1867-c1/index.htm">Capital</a></em>
      but would have inevitably have been crushed by want. Moreover, the
      prevailing doctrines and trends of petty-bourgeois socialism, and of
      non-proletarian socialism in general, forced Marx to wage a continuous and
      merciless struggle and sometime to repel the most savage and monstrous

<!-- vol=21 pg=049 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

	  personal attacks (<em>Herr Vogt</em>).<sup class="ednote"><a
	 name="bkV21P049F01" href="#fwV21P049F01">[10]</a></sup> Marx, who stood aloof from circles
      of political exiles, developed his materialist theory in a number of
      historical works (see <a href="ch06.htm"><em>Bibliography</em></a>), 
	  devoting himself mainly to a study of political economy. Marx revolutionized 
	  science (see <a href="ch02.htm">&#8220;The Marxist Doctrine&#8221;</a>, below) in his <a
      href="../../../../marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/index.htm"><em>Contribution
      to the Critique of Political Economy</em></a> (1859) and <em>Capital</em>
      (Vol. I, 1867).</p>

  	  <p>
      The revival of the democratic movements in the late fifties and in the
      sixties recalled Marx to practical activity. In 1864 (September 28) the
      International Working Men&#8217;s Association&#8212;the celebrated First
      International&#8212;was founded in London. Marx was the heart and soul of
      this organization, and author of its first Address<sup class="ednote"><a
  	 name="bkV21P049F02" href="#fwV21P049F02">[11]</a></sup> and of a host of resolutions,
      declaration and manifestoes. In uniting the labor movement of various forms
      of non-proletarian, pre-Marxist socialism (Mazzini, Proudhon, Bakunin,
      liberal trade-unionism in Britain, Lassallean vacillations to the right in
      Germany, etc.), and in combating the theories of all these sects and
      schools, Marx hammered out a uniform tactic for the proletarian struggle of
      the working in the various countries. Following the downfall of the Paris
      Commune (1871)&#8212;of which gave such a profound, clear-cut, brilliant
      <em>effective</em> and revolutionary analysis (<a
      href="../../../../marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/index.htm"><em>The
      Civil War In France</em></a>, 1871)&#8212;and the Bakunin-caused<sup class="ednote"><a
  	 name="bkV21P049F03" href="#fwV21P049F03">[12]</a></sup> cleavage in
      the International, the latter organization could no longer exist in
      Europe. After the Hague Congress of the International (1872), Marx had the
      General Council of the International had played its historical part, and now
      made way for a period of a far greater development of the labor movement in
      all countries in the world, a period in which the movement grew in
      <em>scope</em>, and <em>mass</em> socialist working-class parties in
      individual national states were formed.</p>
  
  	  <p>
  	  Marx&#8217;s health was undermined by his strenuous work in the
      International and his still more strenuous theoretical occupations. He
      continued work on the refashioning of political economy and on the
      completion of <em>Capital</em>, for which he collected a mass of new
      material and studied a number of languages (Russian, for instance). However,
      ill-health prevented him from completing <em>Capital</em>.</p>

      <p>
      His wife died on December 2, 1881, and on March 14, 1883, Marx passed away
      peacefully in his armchair. He lies buried next to his wife at Highgate
      Cemetery in London. Of Marx&#8217;s children some died in childhood in
      London, when the family were living in destitute circumstances. Three
      daughters married English and French socialists; Eleanor Aveling, Laura
      Lafargue and Jenny Longuet. The latters&#8217; son is a member of the
      French Socialist Party.

    socialism, hostile to Marxism, so called after its ideologist, the French
    anarchist Pierre Joseph Proudhon. Proudhon criticized big capitalist
    property from the petty-bourgeois position and dreamed of perpetuating small
    private ownership. He proposed the foundation of
    &#8220;people&#8217;s&#8221; and &#8220;exchange&#8221; banks, with the aid
    of which the workers would be able to acquire the means of production,
    become handicraftsmen and ensure the just marketing of their
    produce. Proudhon did not understand the historic role of the proletariat
    and displayed a negative attitude to the class struggle, the proletarian
    revolution, and the dictatorship of the proletariat; as an anarchist, he
    denied the need for the state. Marx subjected Proudhonism to ruthless
