	 <h3 title="ch02">The Marxist Doctrine</h3>

      <p class="fst">
   	  Marxism is the system of Marx&#8217;s views and teachings. Marx was the
      genius who continued and consummated the three main ideological currents of
      the 19th century, as represented by the three most advanced countries of
      mankind: classical German philosophy, classical English political economy,
      and French socialism combined with French revolutionary doctrines in
      general. Acknowledged even by his opponents, the remarkable consistency and
      integrity of Marx&#8217;s views, whose totality constitutes modern
      materialism and modern scientific socialism, as the theory and programme of
      the working-class movement in all the civilized countries of the world, make
      it incumbent on us to present a brief outline of his world-conception in
      general, prior to giving an exposition of the principal content of Marxism,
      namely, Marx&#8217;s economic doctrine.

  <a id="s1" name="s1"></a>
  
      Beginning with the years 1844&#8211;45, when his views took shape, Marx was a
      materialist and especially a follower of Ludwig Feuerbach, whose weak point
      he subsequently saw only in his materialism being insufficiently consistent
      and comprehensive. To Marx, Feuerbach&#8217;s historic and
      &#8220;epoch-making&#8221; significance lay in his having resolutely broken
      with Hegel&#8217;s idealism and in his proclamation of materialism, which
      already &#8220;in the 18th century, particularly French materialism, was not
      only a struggle against the existing political institutions and
      against... religion and
  
  <!-- vol=21 pg=051 src=v21pp74h type= --> 
  
  	  theology, but also... against all metaphysics&#8221;
      (in the sense of &#8220;drunken speculation&#8221; as distinct from
      &#8220;sober philosophy&#8221;). (<em><a
      href="../../../../marx/works/1845/holy-family/index.htm">The Holy
      Family,</a></em> in <em>Literarischer Nachlass</em><sup class="ednote"><a
  	 name="bkV21P051F01" href="#fwV21P051F01">[1]</a></sup>)
      &#8220;To Hegel... ,&#8221; wrote Marx, &#8220;the process of thinking,
      which, under the name of &#8216;the Idea&#8217;, he even transforms into
      an independent subject, is the demiurgos (the creator, the maker) of the
      real world.... With me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing else than
      the material world reflected by the human mind, and translated into forms
      of thought.&#8221; (<em><a
      href="../../../../marx/works/1867-c1/index.htm">Capital</a></em>,
      Vol. I, <a href="../../../../marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm">Afterward to
      the Second Edition</a>.) In full conformity with this materialist
      philosophy of Marx&#8217;s, and expounding it, Frederick Engels wrote in
      <em><a
      href="../../../../marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/index.htm">Anti-Duhring</a></em>
      (read by Marx in the manuscript):

      &#8220;The real unity of the world consists in its materiality, and this
      is proved... by a long and wearisome development of philosophy and natural
      science....&#8221;

      &#8220;Motion is the mode of existence of matter. Never anywhere has there
      been matter without motion, or motion without matter, nor can there
      be.... Bit if the... question is raised: what thought and consciousness
      really are, and where they come from; it becomes apparent that they are
      products of the human brain and that man himself is a product of Nature,
      which has developed in and along with its environment; hence it is
      self-evident that the products of the human brain, being in the last
      analysis also products of Nature, do not contradict the rest of
      Nature&#8217;s interconnections but are in correspondence with
      them....</p>

	  <p>
	  &#8220;Hegel was an idealist, that is to say, the thoughts within his
      mind were to him not the more or less abstract images [<em>Abbilder</em>,
      reflections; Engels sometimes speaks of &#8220;imprints&#8221;] of real things and
      processes, but on the contrary, things and their development were to him
      only the images, made real, of the &#8220;Idea&#8221; existing somewhere or
      other before the world existed.&#8221;</p>

	  <p>
      In his <em>Ludwig Feuerbach</em>&#8212;which expounded his own and
      Marx&#8217;s views on Feuerbach&#8217;s philosophy, and was sent to the
      printers after he had re-read an old manuscript Marx and himself had
      written in 1844-45 on Hegel, Feuerbach and the materialist conception of
      history&#8212;Engels wrote:</p>

	  <p class="quote">
      &#8220;The great basic question of all philosophy, especially of more
      recent philosophy, is the relation of thinking and being... spirit to
      Nature... which

<!-- vol=21 pg=052 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

	  is primary, spirit or Nature.... The answers which the
      philosophers gave to this question split them into two great camps. Those
      who asserted the primary of spirit to Nature and, therefore, in the last
      instance, assumed world creation in some form or other... comprised the
      camp of idealism. The others, who regarded Nature as primary, belonged to
      the various schools of materialism.&#8221;</p>

      <p>
	  Any other use of the concepts of (philosophical) idealism and materialism
      leads only to confusion. Marx decidedly rejected, not only idealism, which
      is always linked in one way or another with religion, but also the
      views&#8212;especially widespread in our day&#8212;of Hume and Kant,
      agnosticism, criticism, and positivism<sup class="ednote"><a
	  name="bkV21P052F01" href="#fwV21P052F01">[2]</a></sup> in their various 
	  forms; he considered that philosophy a &#8220;reactionary&#8221; concession 
	  to idealism, and at best a &#8220;shame-faced way of surreptitiously accepting 
	  materialism, while denying it before the world.&#8221;<sup class="ednote"><a
	  name="bkV21P052F02" href="#fwV21P052F02">[3]</a></sup></p>

	  <p>
	  On this question, see, besides the
      works by Engels and Marx mentioned above, a letter Marx wrote to Engels on
      December 12, 1868, in which, referring to an utterance by the naturalist
      Thomas Huxley, which was &#8220;more materialistic&#8221; than usual, and
      to his recognition that &#8220;as long as we actually observe and think,
      we cannot possibly get away from materialism&#8221;, Marx reproached Huxley for
      leaving a &#8220;loop hole&#8221; for agnosticism, for Humism.</p>

	  <p>
      It is particularly important to note Marx&#8217;s view on the relation
      between freedom and necessity: &#8220;Freedom is the appreciation of
      necessity. &#8216;Necessity is blind only insofar as it is not
      understood.&#8217;&#8221; (Engels in <em>Anti-Duhring</em>)
      This means recognition of the rule of objective laws in Nature and of the 
	  dialectical transformation of necessity into freedom (in the same manner 
	  as the transformation of the uncognized but cognizable
      &#8220;thing-in-itself&#8221; into the &#8220;thing-for-us&#8221;, of the
      &#8220;essence of things&#8221; into &#8220;phenomena&#8221;). Marx and Engels
      considered that the &#8220;old&#8221; materialism, including that of
      Feuerbach (and still more the &#8220;vulgar&#8221; materialism of Buchner,
      Vogt and Moleschott), contained the following major shortcomings:</p>

	<h4 class="inline">Dialectics</h4>

    <p>
	<a id="s2" name="s2"></a> 
	As the most comprehensive and profound doctrine of development, and the
    richest in content, Hegelian dialectics was considered by Marx and Engels
    the greatest achievement of classical German philosophy. They thought that
    any other formulation of the principle of development, of evolution, was
    one-sided and poor in content, and could only distort and mutilate the
    actual course of development (which often proceeds by leaps, and via
    catastrophes and revolutions) in Nature and in society.</p>

	<p>
    &#8220;Marx and I were pretty well the only people to rescue conscious
    dialectics [from the destruction of idealism, including Hegelianism] and
    apply it in the materialist conception of Nature.... Nature is the proof of
    dialectics, and it must be said for modern natural science that it has
    furnished extremely rich [this was written before the discovery of radium,
    electrons, the transmutation of elements, etc.!] and daily increasing
    materials for this test, and has thus proved that in the last analysis
    Nature&#8217;s process is dialectical and not metaphysical.</p>

    <p>
	&#8220; The great basic thought,&#8221; Engels writes, &#8220;that the
	world is not to be comprehended as a complex of ready-made things, but as a
    complex of processes, in which the things apparently stable no less than
    their mind images in our heads, the concepts, go through an uninterrupted
    change of coming into being and passing away... this great fundamental
    thought has, especially since the time of Hegel, so thoroughly permeated
    ordinary consciousness that in this generality it is now scarcely ever
    contradicted. But to acknowledge this fundamental thought in words and to
    apply it in reality in detail to each domain of investigation are two
    different things.... For dialectical philosophy nothing is final, absolute,

<!-- vol=21 pg=054 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

    sacred. It reveals the transitory character of everything and in everything;
    nothing can endure before it except the uninterrupted process of becoming
    and of passing away, of endless ascendancy from the lower to the higher. And
    dialectical philosophy itself is nothing more than the mere reflection of
    this process in the thinking brain.&#8221; Thus, according to Marx,
    dialectics is &#8220;the science of the general laws of motion, both of the
    external world and of human thought.&#8221;<sup class="ednote"><a name="bkV21P054F01"
    href="#fwV21P054F01">[4]</a></sup></p>

	<p>
	This revolutionary aspect of Hegel&#8217;s philosophy was adopted and
    developed by Marx. Dialectical materialism &#8220;does not need any
    philosophy standing above the other sciences.&#8221; From previous
    philosophy there remains &#8220;the science of thought and its laws&#8212;formal
    logic and dialectics.&#8221; Dialectics, as understood by Marx, and also in
    conformity with Hegel, includes what is now called the theory of knowledge,
    or epistemology, studying and generalizing the original and development of
    knowledge, the transition from <em>non</em>-knowledge to knowledge.</p>

	<p>
	In our times, the idea of development, of evolution, has almost
    completely penetrated social consciousness, only in other ways, and not
    through Hegelian philosophy. Still, this idea, as formulated by Marx and
    Engels on the basis of Hegels&#8217; philosophy, is far more comprehensive
    and far richer in content than the current idea of evolution is. A
    development that repeats, as it were, stages that have already been passed,
    but repeats them in a different way, on a higher basis (&#8220;the negation of the
    negation&#8221;), a development, so to speak, that proceeds in spirals, not in a
    straight line; a development by leaps, catastrophes, and revolutions;
    &#8220;breaks in continuity&#8221;; the transformation of quantity into quality;
    inner impulses towards development, imparted by the contradiction and
    conflict of the various forces and tendencies acting on a given body, or
    within a given phenomenon, or within a given society; the interdependence
    and the closest and indissoluble connection between <em>all</em> aspects of
    any phenomenon (history constantly revealing ever new aspects), a connection
    that provides a uniform, and universal process of motion, one that follows
    definite laws&#8212;these are some of the features of dialectics as a
    doctrine of development that is richer than the conventional

<!-- vol=21 pg=055 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

    one. (Cf. Marx&#8217;s letter to Engels of January 8, 1868, in which he
    ridicules Stein&#8217;s &#8220;wooden trichotomies,&#8221; which it would be
    absurd to confuse with materialist dialectics.)</p>

	<h4 class="inline">The Materialist Conception of History</h4>

    <p>
	<a id="s3" name="s3"></a>
	A realization of the inconsistency, incompleteness, and onesidedness of
    the old materialism convinced Marx of the necessity of &#8220;bringing the
    science of society... into harmony with the materialist foundation, and of
    reconstructing it thereupon.&#8221;<sup class="ednote"><a
	name="bkV21P055F01" href="#fwV21P055F01">[5]</a></sup> Since materialism in general explains consciousness
    as the outcome of being, and not conversely, then materialism as applied to
    the social life of mankind has to explain <em>social</em> consciousness as
    the outcome of <em>social</em> being. &#8220;Technology,&#8221; Marx writes
    (<em>Capital</em>, Vol. I), &#8220;discloses man&#8217;s mode of dealing
    with Nature, the immediate process of production by which he sustains his
    life, and thereby also lays bare the mode of formation of his social
    relations, and of the mental conceptions that flow from them.&#8221;<sup 
	class="ednote"><a name="bkV21P055F02" href="#fwV21P055F02">[6]</a></sup> In the preface
    to his <em>Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</em>, Marx
    gives an integral formulation of the fundamental principles of materialism
    as applied to human society and its history, in the following words:</p>

    <p class="quote">
	&#8220;In the social production of their life, men enter
    into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their
    will, relations of production which correspond to a definite stage of
    development of their material productive forces.</p>

    <p class="quote">
	&#8220;The sum total of these relations of production
    constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which
    rises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite
    forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life
    conditions the social, political and intellectual life process in
    general. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being,
    but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their
    consciousness. At a certain stage of their development, the material
    productive forces of society come in conflict with the existing relations of
    production, or&#8212;what is but a legal expression for the same
    thing&#8212;with the property relations within which they have been at work

<!-- vol=21 pg=056 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

    hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations
    turn into their fetters. Then begins an epoch of social revolution. With the
    change of the economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is more
    or less rapidly transformed. In considering such transformations a
    distinction should always be made between the material transformation of the
    economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the
    precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, aesthetic
    or philosophic&#8212;in short, ideological forms in which men become
    conscious of this conflict and fight it out.</p>

    <p class="quote">
	&#8220;Just as our opinion of an individual is not based on
    what he thinks of himself, so we cannot judge of such a period of
    transformation by its own consciousness; on the contrary, this consciousness
    must be explained rather from the contradictions of material life, from the
    existing conflict between the social productive forces and the relations of
    production.... In broad outlines, Asiatic, ancient, feudal, and modern
    bourgeois modes of production can be designated as progressive epochs in the
    economic formation of society.&#8221;<sup class="ednote"><a
	name="bkV21P056F01" href="#fwV21P056F01">[7]</a></sup> <span class="inote">[Cf. Marx&#8217;s
    brief formulation in a letter to Engels dated July 7, 1866: &#8220;Our
    theory that the organization of labor is determined by the means of
    production.&#8221;]</span></p>

	<p>
	The discovery of the materialist conception of history, or more
    correctly, the consistent continuation and extension of materialism into the
    domain of social phenomena, removed the two chief shortcomings in earlier
    historical theories. In the first place, the latter at best examined only
    the ideological motives in the historical activities of human beings,
    without investigating the origins of those motives, or ascertaining the
    objective laws governing the development of the system of social relations,
    or seeing the roots of these relations in the degree of development reached
    by material production; in the second place, the earlier theories did not
    embrace the activities of the <em>masses</em> of the population, whereas
    historical materialism made it possible for the first time to study with
    scientific accuracy the social conditions of the life of the masses, and the
    changes in those conditions. <em>At best</em>, pre-Marxist
    &#8220;sociology&#8221; and historiography brought forth an accumulation of
    raw facts, collected at random, and a description of individual aspects of

<!-- vol=21 pg=057 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

    the historical process. By examining the <em>totality</em> of opposing
    tendencies, by reducing them to precisely definable conditions of life and
    production of the various <em>classes</em> of individual aspects of the
    historical process. By examining the choice of a particular
    &#8220;dominant&#8221; idea or in its interpretation, and by revealing that,
    without exception, all ideas and all the various tendencies <em>stem</em>
    from the condition of the material forces of production, Marxism indicated
    the way to an all-embracing and comprehensive study of the process of the
    rise, development, and decline of socio-economic systems. People make their
    own history but what determines the motives of people, of the mass of
    people&#8212;i.e., what is the sum total of all these clashes in the mass of
    human societies? What are the objective conditions of production of material
    life that form the basis of all man&#8217;s historical activity? What is the
    law of development of these conditions? To all these Marx drew attention and
    indicated the way to a scientific study of history as a single process
    which, with all its immense variety and contradictoriness, is governed by
    definite laws.</p>

	<h4 class="inline">The Class Struggle</h4>

    <p>
    <a id="s4" name="s4"></a>
 	It is common knowledge that, in any given society, the striving of some
    of its members conflict with the strivings of others, that social life is
    full of contradictions, and that history reveals a struggle between nations
    and societies, as well as within nations and societies, and, besides, an
    alternation of periods of revolution and reaction, peace and war, stagnation
    and rapid progress or decline. Marxism has provided the guidance
    &#8212;i.e., the theory of the class struggle&#8212;for the discovery of the
    laws governing this seeming maze and chaos. It is only a study of the sum of
    the strivings of all the members of a given society or group of societies
    that can lead to a scientific definition of the result of those
    strivings. Now the conflicting strivings stem from the difference in the
    position and mode of life of the <em>classes</em> into which each society is
    divided.</p>
	
	<p>
    &#8220;The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of
    class struggles,&#8221; Marx wrote in the <em>Communist Manifesto</em>
    (with the exception of the history of the primitive community, Engels

<!-- vol=21 pg=058 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

    added subsequently). &#8220;Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian,
    lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and
    oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an
    uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended,
    either in a revolutionary reconstruction of society at large, or in the
    common ruin of the contending classes.... The modern bourgeois society
    that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with
    class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of
    oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the
    epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it
    has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more
    splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly
    facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.&#8221;</p>

	<p>
    Ever since the Great French Revolution, European history has, in a number
    of countries, tellingly revealed what actually lies at the bottom of
    events&#8212;the struggle of classes. The Restoration period in
	France<sup class="ednote"><a name="bkV21P058F01"
	href="#fwV21P058F01">[8]</a></sup> already 
	produced a number of historians (Thierry, Guizot, Mignet, and
	Thiers) who, in summing up what was taking place, were obliged to admit
    that the class struggle was taking place, were obliged to admit that the
    class struggle was the key to all French history. The modern period&#8212;that
	of complete victory of the bourgeoisie, representative institutions,
    extensive (if not universal) suffrage, a cheap daily press that is widely
    circulated among the masses, etc., a period of powerful and
    ever-expanding unions of workers and unions of employers, etc.&#8212;has
    shown even more strikingly (though sometimes in a very one-sided,
    &#8220;peaceful&#8221;, and &#8220;constitutional&#8221; form) the class
    struggle as the mainspring of events. The following passage from
    Marx&#8217;s <em>Communist Manifesto</em> will show us what Marx demanded
    of social science as regards an objective analysis of the position of each
    class in modern society, with reference to an analysis of each
    class&#8217;s conditions of development:</p>

	<p class="quote">
    &#8220;Of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie
    today, the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class. The other
    classes decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern Industry; the
    proletariat is its special and essential product. The lower middle class,
    the small manufacturer, the shopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant, all
    these fight against the bourgeoisie, to save from extinction their

<!-- vol=21 pg=059 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

    existence as fractions of the middle class. They are therefore not
    revolutionary, but conservative. Nay more, they are reactionary, for they
    try to roll back the wheel of history. If by chance they are
    revolutionary, they are so only in view of their impending transfer into
    the proletariat; they thus defend not their present, but their future
    interests; they desert their own standpoint to place themselves at that of
    the proletariat.&#8221;</p>

	<p>
	In a number of historical works (see <a href="ch06.htm"><em>Bibliography</em></a>),
	Marx gave brilliant and profound examples of materialist historiography, of 
	an analysis of the position of <em>each</em> individual class, and sometimes
    of various groups or strata within a class, showing plainly why and how
    &#8220;every class struggle is a political struggle.&#8221;<sup class="ednote"><a
	name="bkV21P059F01" href="#fwV21P059F01">[9]</a></sup> The above-quoted passage is an 
	illustration of what a complex network of social relations and <em>transitional</em> 
	stages from one class to another, from the past to the future, was analyzed 
	by Marx so as to determine the resultant of historical development.</p>

	<p>
	Marx&#8217;s economic doctrine is the most profound, comprehensive and
    detailed confirmation and application of his theory.</p>

	<em>Agnoticism</em>&#8212;An idealist philosophical theory asserting that 
	the world in  unknowable, that the human mind is limited and cannot know 
	anything beyond the realms of sensations. Agnosticism has various forms: 
	some agnostics recognize the objective existence of the material world but 
	deny the possibility of knowing it, others deny the existence of the material 
	world on the plea that man cannot know whether anything exists beyond his 
	sensations.</p>

    <p class="fst">
	<em>Criticism</em>&#8212;Kant gave this name to his
    idealist philosophy, considering the criticism of man&#8217;s cognitive
    ability to be the purpose of that philosophy. Kant&#8217;s criticism led him
    to the conviction that human reason cannot know the nature of things.</p>

    <p class="fst">
	<em>Positivism</em>&#8212;A widespread trend in
    bourgeois philosophy and sociology, founded by Comte (1798-1857), a French
    philosopher and sociologist. The positivists deny the possibility of knowing
    inner regularities and relations and deny the significance of philosophy as
    a method of knowing and changing the objective world. They reduce philosophy
    to a summary of the data provided by the various branches of science and to
    a superficial description of the results of direct observation&#8212;i.e.,
    to &#8220;positive&#8221; facts. Positivism considers itself to be
    &#8220;above&#8221; both materialism and idealism but it is actually nothing
    more than a variety of subjective idealism.&#8212;<em>Ed.</em></p>
