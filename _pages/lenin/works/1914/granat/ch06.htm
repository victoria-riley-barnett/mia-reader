  	No complete collection of Marx&#8217;s works and letters has
    yet been published. More works by Marx have been translated into
    Russian than into any other language. The following list of
    Marx&#8217;s writings is arranged in chronological order. In 1841 Marx wrote
    his thesis on Epicurus&#8217;s philosophy. (It was included in
    <em>Literarischer Nachiass</em>, of which more will be said later.) In this
    thesis, Marx still fully adhered to the Hegelian idealist point of view. In
    1842 Marx wrote articles for <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> (Cologne), among
    them a criticism of the free-press debate in the Sixth Rhenish Diet, an
    article on the laws concerning the stealing of timber, another in defence of
    divorcing politics from theology, etc. (partly included in <em>Literarischer
    Nachiass</em>). Here we see signs of Marx&#8217;s transition from idealism
    to materialism and from revolutionary democracy to communism. In 1844, under
    the editorship of Marx and Arnold Ruge, there appeared in Paris
    <em>Deutsche-Franzosische Jahrb&#252;cher</em>, in which this transition
    was finally made. Among Marx&#8217;s articles published in that magazine,
    the most noteworthy are <em>A Criticism of the Hegelian Philosophy of
    Right</em> (besides <em>Literarischer Nachiass</em>, also published as a
    separate pamphlet) and <em>On the Jewish Question</em> (likewise in
    <em>Literarischer Nachiass;</em> issued as a pamphlet brought out by the
    <em>Znaniye</em> Publishers in their Cheap Library, No. 210). In 1845, Marx
    and Engels jointly published, in Frankfort on Main, a pamphlet entitled
    <em>The Holy Family. Against Bruno Bauer and Co.</em> (besides
    <em>Literarischer Nachiass</em>, there are two Russian editions as
    pamphlets: one published by <em>Novy Gobs</em> in St. Petersburg, 1906, the
    other by <em>Vesinik Znaniya</em>, St. Petersburg, 1907). In the spring of
    1845, Marx wrote his theses on Feuerbach (published as an appendix to

<!-- vol=21 pg=081 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

    Frederick Engels&#8217;s pamphlet entitled <em>Ludwig Feuerbach</em> (there
    is a Russian translation). In 1845-47 Marx wrote a number of articles (most
    of which have not been collected, republished, or translated into Russian)
    in the papers <em>Vorw&#228;rts, Deutsche Br&#228;sseler-Zeitung</em>
    (1847); <em>Westphalisches Dampboot</em> (Bide. fold, 1845-48); <em>Der
    Gesellschatsspiegel</em> (Elberfeld, 1846). In 1847 Marx wrote his
    fundamental work against Proudhon, <em>The Poverty of Philosophy</em>, a
    reply to Proudhon&#8217;s work <em>The Philosophy of Poverty</em>. The book
    was published in Brussels and Paris (there have been three publications in
    Russian by <em>Novy Mir</em>, one by G. Lvovich, one by Alexeyeva, and one
    by <em>Prosveshcheniye</em>, all in 1905-06). In 1848 the <em>Speech on Free
    Trade</em> was published in Brussels (Russian translation available),
    followed by the publication in London, in collaboration with Frederick
    Engels, of the celebrated <em>Manifesto of the Communist Party</em>, which has been
    translated into probably all the languages of Europe and into a number of
    other languages (there are about eight Russian publications referring to
    1905 and 1906; by <em>Molot, Kolokol, Alexeyeva, etc.</em>, most of which were
    confiscated. These appeared under various titles: <em>The Communist
    Manifesto, On Communism, Social Classes and Communism, Capitalism and
    Communism, The Philosophy of History</em>. A complete and most accurate
    translation of this, as well as of other works by Marx, will be found in the
    editions of the Emancipation of Labour group, issued
	abroad<sup class="ednote"><a 
	name="bkV21E039" href="#fwV21E039">[31]</a></sup>). From
    June 1, 1848, to May 19, 1849, <em>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em> was
    published in Cologne with Marx as the actual editor-in-chief. His numerous
    articles for that paper, which to this very day remains the finest and
    unsurpassed organ of the revolutionary proletariat, have not been collected
    and republished in full. The most important of them were included in
    <em>Literarischer Nachiass</em>. <em>Wage-Labour and Capital</em>, published in that
    paper, has been repeatedly issued as a pamphlet (four Russian editions, by
    Kozman, <em>Mobot</em>, Myagkov, and Lvovich, 1905 and 1906); also from the
    same paper <em>The Liberals at the Helm</em> (published by Znaniye
    Publishers in their Cheap Library, No. 272, St. Petersburg, 1901). In 1849
    Marx published, in Cologne, <em>Two Political Trials</em> (two speeches in
    his own defence by Marx, who was acquitted by a jury when facing trial on

<!-- vol=21 pg=082 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

    the charge of having violated the press law and called for armed resistance
    to the government. Russian translations are available in five publications
    brought out in 1905 and 1906 by Alexayeva, Molot, Myagkov, <em>Znaniye</em>,
    and <em>Novy Mir</em>). In 1850 Marx published, in Hamburg, six issues of
    the magazine <em>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em>. The most important articles published
    therein were later included in <em>Literarischer Nachiass</em>. Especially
    noteworthy are Marx&#8217;s articles, republished by Engels in 1895 in a
    pamphlet entitled <em>Class Struggles in France, 1848-1850</em> (Russian
    translation, published by M. Malykh, Library, No. 59-60; also in the
    <em>Collection of Historical Works</em>, translated by Bazarov and
    Stepanov and published by Skirmunt, St. Petersburg, 1906; also <em>Thoughts
    and Views of the 20th Century</em>, St. Petersburg, 1912). In 1852 a
    pamphlet by Marx was published in New York under the title of <em>The
    Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</em> (Russian translation in
    publications just mentioned). In the same year a pamphlet was published in
    London under the title of <em>Enth&#252;llungen fiber den Communistenprozess in
    K&#246;ln</em> (Russian translation entitled <em>The Cologne Trial of the
    Communards</em>, Popular Science Library, No. 43, St. Petersburg, 1906,
    Oct. 28).</p> 
	
	<p>
	From August 1851 until 1862,<sup class="ednote"><a 
	name="bkV21P082F01" href="#fwV21P082F01">[1]</a></sup>
	Marx was a regular contributor
    to the <em>New York Tribune</em>, where many of his articles appeared
    unsigned, as editorials. Most outstanding among these is a series of
    articles, <em>Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Germany</em>, which were
    republished after the death of Marx and Engels in a German translation (a
    Russian translation is available in collections translated by Bazarov and
    Stepanov, and then, in pamphlet form, in five editions brought out in
    1905-06 by Alexeyeva, Obshchestvennaya Poiza, Novy Mir, Vseobshchaya
    Biblioteka and <em>Molot</em>). Some of Marx&#8217;s articles in the
    <em>Tribune</em> were later published in London as separate pamphlets, as,
    for instance, the one on Palmerston, published in 1856; <em>Revelations of
    the Diplomatic History of the 18th Century</em> (regarding the constant
    venal dependence on Russia of the British Liberal Ministers), and

<!-- vol=21 pg=083 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

    others. After Marx&#8217;s death, his daughter, Eleanor Aveling, published a
    number of his <em>Tribune</em> articles on the Oriental question, under the
    title of <em>The Eastern Question</em>, London, 1897. Part has been
    translated into Russian: <em>War and Revolution</em>, Issue I, Marx and
    Engels: <em>Unpublished Articles (1852, 1853, 1854)</em>, Kharkov, 1919
    (<em>Our Thought</em> Library). From the end of 1854, and during 1855, Marx
    contributed to the <em>Neue Oder-Zeitung</em> and in 1861-62 to the Viennese
    paper <em>Presse</em>. These articles have not been collected, and only a few of
    them were reprinted in <em>Die Neue Zeit</em>, as were also Marx&#8217;s
    numerous letters. The same is true about Marx&#8217;s articles from <em>Das
    Volk</em> (London, 1859) on the diplomatic history of the Italian War of
    1859. In 1859 Marx&#8217;s <em>Contribution to the Critique of Political
    Economy</em> appeared in Berlin (Russian translations: Moscow, 1896, edited
    by Manuilov; St. Petersburg, 1907, translated by Rumyantsev), In 1860 a
    pamphlet by Marx, entitled <em>Herr Vogt</em>, appeared in London.</p>

	<p>
	In 1864 the <em>Address of the International Workingmen&#8217;s
    Association</em>, which was written by Marx, came out in London (Russian
    translation available). Marx was the author of numerous manifestos, appeals
    and resolutions of the International&#8217;s General Council. This material
    is far from having been analysed or even collected. The first approach to
    this work is Gustav Jaeckh&#8217;s book, <em>Die Internationale</em> (in the
    Russian translation: St. Petersburg, 1906, Znaniye Publishers), which
    includes several of Marx&#8217;s letters and draft resolutions. Among the
    documents of the International that Marx wrote was the <em>Address of the
    General Council on the Paris Commune</em>. The document appeared in 1871
    in London, as a pamphlet entitled <em>The Civil War in France</em>
    (Russian translations: one edited by Lenin, Molot Publishers, and
    others). Between 1862 and 1874 Marx corresponded with Kugelniann, a member
    of the International (two Russian translations: one by A. Goikhbarg, the
    other edited by Lenin). In 1867 Marx&#8217;s main work, <em>Capital: A
    Critique of Political Economy</em>, Vol. 1, appeared in Hamburg. Volumes 2
    and 3 were published by Engels in 1885 and 1894, after the death of
    Marx. The Russian translations: Vol. 1, in five editions (two in a
    translation by Danielson, 1872 and 1898; two in a translation by
    E. A. Gurvich and L. M. Zak, edited

<!-- vol=21 pg=084 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

	by Struve; 1st ed.&#8212;1899, 2nd ed.&#8212;1905; another edited by Bazarov and
    Stepauov). Volumes 2 and 3 appeared in a translation by Danielson (less
    satisfactory) and in another under the editorship of Bazarov and Stepanov
    (the better). In 1876 Marx took part in the writing of Engels&#8217;s
    <em>Herrn Eugen D&#252;hrings Umw&#228;lzung der Wissenschaft
    (Anti-D&#252;hring)</em>; he went over the manuscript of the whole work
    and wrote an entire chapter dealing with the history of political economy.</p>

    <p>
    The following works by Marx were published posthumously: <em>Critique of
    the Gotha Programme</em> (St. Petersburg, 1906, and in German in <em>Die
    Neue Zeit</em>, 1890-91, No, 18); <em>Value, Price and Profit</em> (a
    lecture delivered on June 26, 1865; <em>Die Neue Zeit</em>, XVI, 1897-98; Russian
    translations, brought out by <em>Molot</em>, 1906, and Lvovich, 1905); <em>Aus
	dem literarischen Nachiass von Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels und
    Ferdinand Lassalle</em>, three volumes, Stuttgart, 1902 (Russian
    translation, edited by Axelrod and others, 2 vols., St. Petersburg, 1908:
    Vol. 1 also edited by E. Gurvich, Moscow, 1907. Lassalle&#8217;s letters
    to Marx, published separately, are included in <em>Literarischer
    Nachiass); Letters from K. Marx and F. Engels and Others to F. A. Sorge
    and Others</em> (two editions in Russian; one edited by Axeirod, another
    published by Dauge, with a preface by Lenin); <em>Theorien fiber den
    Mehrwert</em>, three volumes in four parts, Stuttgart, 1905-10, which is
    the manuscript of the fourth volume of <em>Capital</em> and published by
    Kautsky (only the first volume translated into Russian; in three editions;
    St. Petersburg, 1906, edited by Plekhanov; Kiev, 1906, edited by
    Zheleznov, and Kiev, 1907, edited by Tuchapsky). In 1913 four big volumes
    of <em>Marx-Engels Correspondence</em> came out in Stuttgart, with 1,386
    letters written between September 1844 and January 10, 1883, and providing
    a mass of highly valuable material for a study of Marx&#8217;s biography
    and views. In 1917, two volumes of Marx&#8217;s and Engels&#8217;s works
    appeared, containing their articles for 1852-62 (in German). This list of
    Marx&#8217;s works must conclude with a note that many of Marx&#8217;s
    shorter articles and letters, published, for the most part, in <em>Die
    Neue Zeit</em>, <em>Vorw&#252;rts</em>, and other German-language Social-Democratic
    periodicals, have not been enumerated. The list of Russian translations of
    Marx is no doubt incomplete especially with reference to pamphlets that
    appeared in 1905-06.</p>

 	The literature on Marx and Marxism is very extensive. We shall mention
    only what is most outstanding, and divide the authors into three main groups:
    Marxists who, in important matters, adhere to Marx&#8217;s point of view;
    bourgeois writers, in essence hostile to Marxism; and revisionists, who,
    while claiming to accept certain fundamentals of Marxism, in fact replace it
    with bourgeois conceptions. The Narodnik attitude towards Marx should be
    considered a peculiarly Russian variety of revisionism. In his <em>Em
    Beitrag zur Bibliographie des Marxismus</em> (Archiv f&#252;r
    Soztalwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik, XX, 2. Heft,<sup class="ednote"><a

	1905, pp. 413-30), Werner
    Sombart gives some three hundred titles in a list that is far from
    complete. More can be found in the indexes to <em>Die Neue Zeit</em>, 1883-1907,
    et seq., also in Josef Stammhammer&#8217;s <em>Bibliographie des Sozialismus
    und Kommunismus</em>, Bd. I&#8212;III,<sup class="ednote"><a

    which usually escape the attention of the Kantians, Positivists,
    etc.. Likewise: Levy, <em>Feuerbach</em>, a work about one of the main
    philosophical predecessors of Marx. A useful collection of quotations from a
    number of Marx&#8217;s works is contained in Chernyshev&#8217;s <em>Notebook
    of a Marxist</em>, St. Petersburg (Dyelo), 1908. On Marx&#8217;s economic
    doctrine, the following books are outstanding: Karl Kautsky, <em>The
    Economic Doctrines of Karl Marx</em> (numerous editions in Russian), The
    <em>Agrarian Question, The Erfurt Programme</em>, and numerous
    pamphlets. Cf. also: <em>Eduard Bernstein, The Economic Doctrine of
    Marx. The Third Volume of Capital</em> (Russian translation, 1905);
    Gabriel Deville, <em>Capital</em> (an exposition of the first volume of
    <em>Capital</em>, Russian translation, 1907). A representative of so-called
    revisionism among Marxists, as regards the agrarian question, is Eduard
    David, <em>Socialism and Agriculture</em> (Russian translation,
    St. Petersburg, 1902). For a critique of revisionism see V. Ilyin, <em>The
    Agrarian Question</em>, Part I, St. Petersburg, 1908. See also the following
    books by V. Ilyin: <em>The Development of Capitalism in Russia</em>, second
    edition, St. Petersburg, 1908; <em>Economic Essays and Articles</em>,
    St. Petersburg, 1899; <em>New Data on the Laws of Development of Capitalism
    in Agriculture</em>, Book 1, 1917. An application of Marx&#8217;s views,

<!-- vol=21 pg=089 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

    with some deviations, to the latest data concerning agrarian relations in
    France can be found in Cornp&#232;re-Morel, <em>La question agraire et le
    socialisme en France</em>,<sup class="ednote"><a
	name="bkV21P089F01" href="#fwV21P089F01">[20]</a></sup> Paris, 1912, 455 pages. For the further
    development of Marx&#8217;s economic views as applied to recent phenomena in
    economic life see Hilferding&#8217;s <em>Finance Capital</em> [in Russian],
    St. Petersburg, 1911 (outstanding inaccuracies in the author&#8217;s views
    on the theory of value have been corrected by Kautsky in &#8220;Gold, Papier
    und Ware&#8221;,&#8212;&#8220;Gold, Paper Money and Commodities&#8221;&#8212;in <em>Die Neue
    Zeit</em>, XXX, 1; 1912, pp. 837 and 886); and V. Ilyin&#8217;s <em>Imperialism, the
    Highest Stage of Capitalism</em>, 1917. Pyotr Maslov in his <em>Agrarian
    Question</em> (two volumes) and <em>The Theory of Economic Development</em>,
    St. Petersburg, 1910, deviates from Marxism on important points. A
    criticism of some of Maslov&#8217;s deviations may be found in
    Kautsky&#8217;s &#8220;<em>Malthusianism and Socialism</em>&#8221; in
    <em>Die Neue Zeit</em>, XXIX, 1, 1911.</p>

	On the question of the Marxist theory of the accumulation of capital
    there is a new work by Rosa Luxemburg, <em>Die Accumulation des
    Kapitals</em> (Berlin, 1913),<sup class="ednote"><a 
	name="bkV21P090F05" href="#fwV21P090F05">[29]</a></sup>

	<p>
	Of the older Russian literature on Marxism the following should be noted:
    B. Chicherin, &#8220;The German Socialists,&#8221; in Bezobrazov&#8217;s
    <em>Collection of Political Science</em>, St. Petersburg, 1888, and
    <em>The History of Political Doctrines</em>, Part 5, Moscow, 1902, 156
    pages; a reply to the above by Zieber, &#8220;The German Economists Through
    Mr. Chicherin&#8217;s Glasses,&#8221; in his <em>Collected Works</em>,

<!-- vol=21 pg=091 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

    Vol. II, St. Petersburg, 1900; L. Slonimsky, <em>The Economic
    Doctrine of Karl Marx</em>, St. Petersburg, 1898; N. Zieber,
    <em>David Ricardo and Karl Marx in Their Socioeconomic
    Investigations</em>, St. Petersburg, 1885, and his <em>Collected Works</em>,
    in two volumes, St. Petersburg, 1900. Also J. Kaufmann&#8217;s (J. K-n)
    review of <em>Capital</em> in <em>Vesinik Yevropy</em> for 1872, No. 5&#8212;an
    article marked by the fact that, in his addendum to the second edition of
    <em>Capital</em>, Marx quoted J. K-n&#8217;s arguments, recognising them as
    a correct exposition of his dialectical-materialist method.</p>

	<p>
	The Russian Narodniks on Marxism: N. K. Mikhailovskyin <em>Russcoye
    Bogatstvo</em>, 1894, No. 10, and 1895, Nos. 1 and 2; also reprinted in his
    <em>Collected Works</em>&#8212;remarks on P. Struve&#8217;s <em>Critical
    Notes</em> (St. Petersburg, 1894). Mikhailovsky&#8217;s views were analysed
    from a Marxist point of view by K. Tulin (V. Ilyin) in his <em>Data
    Characterising Our Economic Development</em> (St. Petersburg, 1895,
    destroyed by the censor), later reprinted in V. Ilyin&#8217;s <em>For Twelve
    Years</em>, St. Petersburg, 1908. Other Narodnik works: V. V., <em>Our Lines
    of Policy</em>, St. Petersburg, 1892, and <em>From the Seventies to the
    Twentieth Century</em>, St. Petersburg, 1907; Nikolai-on, <em>Outline of Our
    Post-Reform Social Economy</em>, St. Petersburg, 1893; V. Chernov,
    <em>Marxism and the Agrarian Problem</em>, St. Petersburg, 1906,
    and <em>Philosophical and Sociological Sketches</em>, St. Petersburg,
    1907.</p>

	<p>
	Besides the Narodniks, the following may also be mentioned: N. Kareyev,
    <em>Old and New Sketches on Historical Materialism</em>, St.
    Petersburg, 1896, 2nd edition in 1913 under the title <em>A
    Critique of Economic Materialism</em>; Masaryk, <em>Philosophical and
    Sociological Foundations of Marxism</em> [in Russian], Moscow, 1900; Croce,
    <em>Historical Materialism and Marxian Economy</em> [in Russian],
    St. Petersburg, 1902.</p>

	<p>
	For a correct appraisal of Marx&#8217;s views, an acquaintance is
    essential with the works of Frederick Engels, his closest fellow-thinker and
    collaborator. It is impossible to understand Marxism and to propound it
    fully without taking into account all the works of Engels.</p>

	<p>
	For a critique of Marx from the point of view of anarchism, see
    V. Cherkezov, <em>The Doctrines of Marxism</em>, two parts, St. Petersburg,
    1905; V. Tucker, <em>In Lieu of a Book</em> [in Russian], Moscow,  1907;
    Sorel (a syndicalist), <em>Social Studies of Modern Economy</em>, Moscow,
	1908.
