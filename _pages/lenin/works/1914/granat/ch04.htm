      <p>
	  From the foregoing, it is evident that Marx deduces the inevitability of
      the transformation of capitalist society into socialist society and wholly
      and exclusively from the economic law of the development of contemporary
      society. The socialization of labor, which is advancing ever more rapidly
      in thousands of forms and has manifested itself very strikingly, during
      the half-century since the death of Marx, in the growth of large-scale
      production, capitalist cartels, syndicates and trusts, as well as in the
      gigantic increase in the dimensions and power of finance capital, provides
      the principal material foundation for the inevitable advent of
      socialism. The intellectual and moral motive force and the physical
      executor of this transformation is the proletariat, which has been trained
      by capitalism itself. The proletariat&#8217;s struggle against the
      bourgeoisie, which finds expression in a variety of forms ever richer in
      content, inevitably becomes a political struggle directed towards the
      conquest of political power by the proletariat (&#8220;the dictatorship of the
      proletariat&#8221;). The socialization of production cannot but lead to the
      means of production becoming the property of society, to the
      &#8220;expropriation of the expropriators.&#8221; A tremendous rise in labor
      productivity, a shorter working day, and the replacement of the remnants,
      the ruins, of small-scale, primitive and disunited production by
      collective and improved labor&#8212;such are the direct consequences of
      this transformation. Capitalism breaks for all time the ties between
      agriculture and industry, but at the same time, through its highest
      development, it prepares new elements of those ties, a union between
      industry and agriculture based on the conscious application of science and
      the concentration of collective labor, and on a redistribution of the
      human population (thus putting an end both to rural backwardness, isolation and

<!-- vol=21 pg=072 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

	  barbarism, and to the unnatural concentration of vast masses of people in
      big cities). A new form of family, new conditions in the status of women and
      in the upbringing of the younger generation are prepared by the highest
      forms of present-day capitalism: the labor of women and children and the
      break-up of the patriarchal family by capitalism inevitably assume the most
      terrible, disastrous, and repulsive forms in modern society. Nevertheless,</p>

      <p class="quote">&#8220;modern industry, by assigning as it does, an important part in the
      socially organized process of production, outside the domestic sphere, to
      women, to young persons, and to children of both sexes, creates a new
      economic foundation for a higher form of the family and of the relations
      between the sexes. It is, of course, just as absurd to hold the
      Teutonic-Christian form of the family to be absolute and final as it would
      be to apply that character to the ancient Roman, the ancient Greek, or the
      Eastern forms which, moreover, taken together form a series in historic
      development. Moreover, it is obvious that the fact of the collective
      working group being composed of individuals of both sexes and all ages,
      must necessarily, under suitable conditions, become a source of human
      development; although in its spontaneously developed, brutal, capitalistic
      form, where the laborer exists for the process of production, and not the
      process of production for the laborer, that fact is a pestiferous source
      of corruption and slavery.&#8221; (<a

	  The factory system contains</p>

      <p class="quote">&#8220;the germ of the education of the future, an education that will, 
	  in the ease of every child over a given age, combine productive labor with
      instruction and gymnastics, not only as one of the methods of adding to the
      efficiency of social production, but as the only method of producing fully
      developed human beings.&#8221; [<em>ibid</em>.]</p>

      <p>
	  Marx&#8217;s socialism places the problems of nationality and of the state
      on the same historical footing, not only in the sense of explaining the
      past but also in the sense of a bold forecast of the future and of bold
      practical action for its achievement. Nations are an inevitable product,
      an inevitable form, in the bourgeois epoch of social development. The
      working class could not grow strong, become mature and take shape without
      &#8220;constituting itself within the nation,&#8221; without being &#8220;national&#8221;

<!-- vol=21 pg=073 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

	  (&#8220;though
      not in the bourgeois sense of the word&#8221;). The development of capitalism,
      however, breaks down national barriers more and more, does away with
      national seclusion, and substitutes class antagonisms for national
      antagonism. It is, therefore, perfectly true of the developed capitalist
      countries that &#8220;the workingmen have no country&#8221; and that &#8220;united action&#8221;
      by the workers, of the civilized countries at least, &#8220;is one of the first
      conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat&#8221; [<em><a
      href="../../../../marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/index.htm">Communist
      Manifesto</a></em>]. That state, which is organized coercion, inevitably
      came into being at a definite stage in the development of society, when
      the latter had split into irreconcilable classes, and could not exist
      without an &#8220;authority&#8221; ostensibly standing above society, and to a certain
      degree separate from society. Arising out of class contradictions, the
      state becomes &#8220;...the state of the most powerful, economically dominant
      class, which, through the medium of the state, becomes also the
      politically dominant class, and thus acquires new means of holding down
      and exploiting the oppressed class. Thus, the state of antiquity was above
      all the state of the slave-owners for the purpose of holding down the
      slaves, as the feudal state was the organ of the nobility for holding down
      the peasant serfs and bondsmen, and the modern representative state is an
      instrument of exploitation of wage labor by capital.&#8221; (Engels, <em><a
      href="../../../../marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/index.htm">The
      Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State</a></em>, a work in
      which the writer expounds his own views and Marx&#8217;s.) Even the
      democratic republic, the freest and most progressive form of the bourgeois
      state, does not eliminate this fact in any way, but merely modifies its
      form (the links between government and the stock exchange, the
      corruption&#8212;direct and indirect&#8212;of officialdom and the press,
      etc.). By leading to the abolition of classes, socialism will thereby lead
      to the abolition of the state as well. &#8220;The first act,&#8221; Engels writes in
      <em><a
      href="../../../../marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/index.htm">Anti-D&#252;hring</a></em>
      &#8220;by virtue of which the state really constitutes itself the representative
      of society as a whole&#8212;the taking possession of the means of
      production in the name of society&#8212;is, at the same time, its last
      independent act as a state. The state interference in social relations
      becomes superfluous in one sphere after another, and then ceases of
      itself. The government of persons is replaced by the administration of
      things and by the direction of the processes

<!-- vol=21 pg=074 src=v21pp74h type= --> 

	  of production. The state is not &#8216;abolished,&#8217; it withers away&#8221;
      [<em><a href="../../../../marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/index.htm">Anti-D&#252;hring</a></em>].</p>

      <p class="quote">&#8220;The society that will organize production on the basis 
	  of a free and equal
      association of the producers will put the whole machinery of state where
      it will then belong: into the Museum of Antiquities, by the side of the
      spinning wheel and the bronze axe.&#8221; [Engels, <em>The Origin of the Family,
	  Private Property and the State</em>].</p>

      <p>
      Finally, as regards the attitude of Marx&#8217;s socialism towards the
      small peasantry, which will continue to exist in the period of the
      expropriation of the expropriators, we must refer to a declaration made by
      Engels, which expresses Marx&#8217;s views:</p>

      <p class="quote">&#8220;...when we are in possession of state power we shall 
	  not even think of
      forcibly expropriating the small peasants (regardless of whether with or
      without compensation), as we shall have to do in the case of the big
      landowners. Our task relative to the small peasant consists, in the first
      place, in effecting a transition of his private enterprise and private
      possession to co-operative ones, not forcibly but by dint of example and the
      proffer of social assistance for this purpose. And then of course we shall
      have ample means of showing to the small peasant prospective advantages that
      must be obvious to him even today.&#8221; [Engels, <a
