### Preface {#preface title="ch00"}

This article on Karl Marx, which now appears in a separate printing, was
written in 1913 (as far as I can remember) for the *Granat
Encyclopaedia*. A fairly detailed bibliography of literature on Marx,
mostly foreign, was appended to the article. This has been omitted in
the present edition. The editor of the Encyclopaedia, for their part,
have, for censorship reasons, deleted the end of the article on Marx,
namely, the section dealing with his revolutionary tactics.
Unfortunately, I am unable to reproduce that end, because the draft has
remained among my papers somewhere in Krakow or in Switzerland. I only
remember that in the concluding part of the article I quoted, among
other things, the passage from Marx's letter to Engels of April 16,
1856, in which he wrote: "The whole thing in Germany will depend on the
possibility of backing the proletarian revolution by some second edition
of the Peasant War. Then the affair will be splendid." That is what our
Mensheviks, who have now sunk to utter betrayal of socialism and to
desertion to the bourgeoisie, have failed to understand since 1905.
