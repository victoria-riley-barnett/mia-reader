### The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism[]{#bkV19E003}

This article was published in 1913 in *Prosveshcheniye* No. 3, dedicated
to the Thirtieth Anniversary of Marx's death.

*Prosveshcheniye* (*Enlightenment*) was a Bolshevik social, political
and literary monthly published legally in St. Petersburg from December
1911 onwards. Its inauguration was proposed by Lenin to replace the
Bolshevik journal *Mysl* (*Thought*), a Moscow publication banned by the
tsarist government. Lenin directed the work of the journal from abroad
and wrote the following articles for it: "Fundamental Problems of the
Election Campaign", "Results of the Election", "Critical Remarks on the
National Question", "The Right of Nations to Self-Determination", and
others.

The journal was suppressed by the tsarist government in June 1914, on
the eve of the First World War. Publication was resumed in the autumn of
1917 but only one double number appeared; this number contained two
articles by Lenin: "Can the Bolsheviks Retain State Power?" and "A
Review of the Party Programme".

Throughout the civilised world the teachings of Marx evoke the utmost
hostility and hatred of all bourgeois science (both official and
liberal), which regards Marxism as a kind of "pernicious sect". And no
other attitude is to be expected, for there can be no "impartial" social
science in a society based on class struggle. In one way or another,
*all* official and liberal science *defends* wage-slavery, whereas
Marxism has declared relentless war on that slavery. To expect science
to be impartial in a wage-slave society is as foolishly naïve as to
expect impartiality from manufacturers on the question of whether
workers' wages ought not to be increased by decreasing the profits of
capital.

But this is not all. The history of philosophy and the history of social
science show with perfect clarity that there is nothing resembling
"sectarianism" in Marxism, in the sense of its being a hidebound,
petrified doctrine, a doctrine which arose *away from* the high road of
the development of world civilisation. On the contrary, the genius of
Marx consists precisely in his having furnished answers to questions
already raised by the foremost minds of mankind. His doctrine emerged as
the direct and immediate *continuation* of the teachings of the greatest
representatives of philosophy, political economy and socialism.

The Marxist doctrine is omnipotent because it is true. It is
comprehensive and harmonious, and provides men with an integral world
outlook irreconcilable with any form of superstition, reaction, or
defence of bourgeois oppression. It is the legitimate successor to the
best that man produced in the nineteenth century, as represented by
German philosophy, English political economy and French socialism.

It is these three sources of Marxism, which are also its component parts
that we shall outline in brief.

#### I

The philosophy of Marxism is *materialism*. Throughout the modern
history of Europe, and especially at the end of the eighteenth century
in France, where a resolute struggle was conducted against every kind of
medieval rubbish, against serfdom in institutions and ideas, materialism
has proved to be the only philosophy that is consistent, true to all the
teachings of natural science and hostile to superstition, cant and so
forth. The enemies of democracy have, therefore, always exerted all
their efforts to "refute", under mine and defame materialism, and have
advocated various forms of philosophical idealism, which always, in one
way or another, amounts to the defence or support of religion.

Marx and Engels defended philosophical materialism in the most
determined manner and repeatedly explained how profoundly erroneous is
every deviation from this basis. Their views are most clearly and fully
expounded in the works of Engels, *Ludwig Feuerbach* and *Anti-Dühring*,
which, like the *Communist Manifesto*, are handbooks for every
class-conscious worker.

But Marx did not stop at eighteenth-century materialism: he developed
philosophy to a higher level, he enriched it with the achievements of
German classical philosophy, especially of Hegel's system, which in its
turn had led to the materialism of Feuerbach. The main achievement was
*dialectics*, i.e., the doctrine of development in its fullest, deepest
and most comprehensive form, the doctrine of the relativity of the human
knowledge that provides us with a reflection of eternally developing
matter. The latest discoveries of natural science---radium, electrons,
the transmutation of elements---have been a remarkable confirmation of
Marx's dialectical materialism despite the teachings of the bourgeois
philosophers with their "new" reversions to old and decadent idealism.

Marx deepened and developed philosophical materialism to the full, and
extended the cognition of nature to include the cognition of *human
society*. His *historical materialism* was a great achievement in
scientific thinking. The chaos and arbitrariness that had previously
reigned in views on history and politics were replaced by a strikingly
integral and harmonious scientific theory, which shows how, in
consequence of the growth of productive forces, out of one system of
social life another and higher system develops---how capitalism, for
instance, grows out of feudalism.

Just as man's knowledge reflects nature (i.e., developing matter), which
exists independently of him, so man's *social knowledge* (i.e., his
various views and doctrines---philosophical, religious, political and so
forth) reflects the *economic system* of society. Political institutions
are a superstructure on the economic foundation. We see, for example,
that the various political forms of the modern European states serve to
strengthen the domination of the bourgeoisie over the proletariat.

Marx's philosophy is a consummate philosophical materialism which has
provided mankind, and especially the working class, with powerful
instruments of knowledge.

#### II

Having recognised that the economic system is the foundation on which
the political superstructure is erected, Marx devoted his greatest
attention to the study of this economic system. Marx's principal work,
*Capital*, is devoted to a study of the economic system of modern, i.e.,
capitalist, society.

Classical political economy, before Marx, evolved in England, the most
developed of the capitalist countries. Adam Smith and David Ricardo, by
their investigations of the economic system, laid the foundations of the
*labour theory of value*. Marx continued their work; he provided a proof
of the theory and developed it consistently. He showed that the value of
every commodity is determined by the quantity of socially necessary
labour time spent on its production.

Where the bourgeois economists saw a relation between things (the
exchange of one commodity for another) Marx revealed a *relation between
people*. The exchange of commodities expresses the connection between
individual producers through the market. *Money* signifies that the
connection is becoming closer and closer, inseparably uniting the entire
economic life of the individual producers into one whole. *Capital*
signifies a further development of this connection: man's labour-power
becomes a commodity. The wage-worker sells his labour-power to the owner
of land, factories and instruments of labour. The worker spends one part
of the day covering the cost of maintaining himself and his family
(wages), while the other part of the day he works without remuneration,
creating for the capitalist *surplus-value*, the source of profit, the
source of the wealth of the capitalist class.

The doctrine of surplus-value is the corner-stone of Marx's economic
theory.

Capital, created by the labour of the worker, crushes the worker,
ruining small proprietors and creating an army of unemployed. In
industry, the victory of large-scale production is immediately apparent,
but the same phenomenon is also to be observed in agriculture, where the
superiority of large-scale capitalist agriculture is enhanced, the use
of machinery increases and the peasant economy, trapped by
money-capital, declines and falls into ruin under the burden of its
backward technique. The decline of small-scale production assumes
different forms in agriculture, but the decline itself is an
indisputable fact.

By destroying small-scale production, capital leads to an increase in
productivity of labour and to the creation of a monopoly position for
the associations of big capitalists. Production itself becomes more and
more social---hundreds of thousands and millions of workers become bound
together in a regular economic organism---but the product of this
collective labour is appropriated by a handful of capitalists. Anarchy
of production, crises, the furious chase after markets and the
insecurity of existence of the mass of the population are intensified.

By increasing the dependence of the workers on capital, the capitalist
system creates the great power of united labour.

Marx traced the development of capitalism from embryonic commodity
economy, from simple exchange, to its highest forms, to large-scale
production.

And the experience of all capitalist countries, old and new, year by
year demonstrates clearly the truth of this Marxian doctrine to
increasing numbers of workers.

Capitalism has triumphed all over the world, but this triumph is only
the prelude to the triumph of labour over capital.

#### III

When feudalism was overthrown and "*free*" capitalist society appeared
in the world, it at once became apparent that this freedom meant a new
system of oppression and exploitation of the working people. Various
socialist doctrines immediately emerged as a reflection of and protest
against this oppression. Early socialism, however, was *utopian*
socialism. It criticised capitalist society, it condemned and damned it,
it dreamed of its destruction, it had visions of a better order and
endeavoured to convince the rich of the immorality of exploitation.

But utopian socialism could not indicate the real solution. It could not
explain the real nature of wage-slavery under capitalism, it could not
reveal the laws of capitalist development, or show what *social force*
is capable of becoming the creator of a new society.

Meanwhile, the stormy revolutions which everywhere in Europe, and
especially in France, accompanied the fall of feudalism, of serfdom,
more and more clearly revealed the *struggle of classes* as the basis
and the driving force of all development.

Not a single victory of political freedom over the feudal class was won
except against desperate resistance. Not a single capitalist country
evolved on a more or less free and democratic basis except by a
life-and-death struggle between the various classes of capitalist
society.

The genius of Marx lies in his having been the first to deduce from this
the lesson world history teaches and to apply that lesson consistently.
The deduction he made is the doctrine of the *class struggle*.

People always have been the foolish victims of deception and
self-deception in politics, and they always will be until they have
learnt to seek out the *interests* of some class or other behind all
moral, religious, political and social phrases, declarations and
promises. Champions of reforms and improvements will always be fooled by
the defenders of the old order until they realise that every old
institution, how ever barbarous and rotten it may appear to be, is kept
going by the forces of certain ruling classes. And there is *only one*
way of smashing the resistance of those classes, and that is to find, in
the very society which surrounds us, the forces which can---and, owing
to their social position, must---constitute the power capable of
sweeping away the old and creating the new, and to enlighten and
organise those forces for the struggle.

Marx's philosophical materialism alone has shown the proletariat the way
out of the spiritual slavery in which all oppressed classes have
hitherto languished. Marx's economic theory alone has explained the true
position of the proletariat in the general system of capitalism.

Independent organisations of the proletariat are multi plying all over
the world, from America to Japan and from Sweden to South Africa. The
proletariat is becoming enlightened and educated by waging its class
struggle; it is ridding itself of the prejudices of bourgeois society;
it is rallying its ranks ever more closely and is learning to gauge the
measure of its successes; it is steeling its forces and is growing
irresistibly.
