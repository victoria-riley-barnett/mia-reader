    <h4>
      What a torch of reason ceased to burn, <br />What a heart has ceased to

    <p class="fst">
      On<a onmouseover="window.status=' 02 . 019 . v02zz99h . GUESS '" onmouseout="window.status=''"> </a>August 5 (new style), 1895, Frederick Engels died in London. After his
      friend Karl Marx (who died in 1883), Engels was the finest scholar and
      teacher of the modern proletariat in the whole civilised world. From the
      time that fate brought Karl Marx and Frederick Engels together, the two
      friends devoted their life&#8217;s work to a common cause. And so to understand
      what Frederick Engels has done for the proletariat, one must have a clear
      idea of the significance of Marx&#8217;s teaching and work for the development
      of the contemporary working-class movement. Marx and Engels were the first
      to show that the working class and its demands are a necessary outcome of
      the present economic system, which together with the bourgeoisie
      inevitably creates and organises the proletariat. They showed that it is
      not the well-meaning efforts of noble-minded individuals, but the class
      struggle of the organised proletariat that will deliver humanity from the
      evils which now oppress it. In their scientific works, Marx and Engels
      were the first to explain that socialism is not the invention of dreamers,
      but the final aim and necessary result of the development of the
      productive forces in modern society. All recorded history hitherto has
      been a history of class struggle, of the succession of the rule and
      victory of certain social classes over others. And this will continue
      until the foundations of class struggle and of class domination &#8211; private
      property and anarchic social production &#8211; disappear. The interests of the
      proletariat demand the destruction of these foundations, and therefore the
      conscious class struggle of the organised workers must be directed against
      them. And every class struggle is a political struggle.

    </p>
    <p>
      These views of Marx and Engels have now been adopted by all proletarians
      who are fighting for their emancipation.
      But when in the forties the two friends took part in the socialist
      literature and the social movements of their time, they were absolutely
      novel. There were then many people, talented and without talent, honest
      and dishonest, who, absorbed in the struggle for political freedom, in the
      struggle against the despotism of kings, police and priests, failed to
      observe the antagonism between the interests of the bourgeoisie and those
      of the proletariat. These people would not entertain the idea of the
      workers acting as an independent social force. On the other hand, there
      were many dreamers, some of them geniuses, who thought that it was only
      necessary to convince the rulers and the governing classes of the
      injustice of the contemporary social order, and it would then be easy to
      establish peace and general well-being on earth. They dreamt of a
      socialism without struggle. Lastly, nearly all the socialists of that time
      and the friends of the working class generally regarded the proletariat
      only as an <em>ulcer</em>, and observed with horror how it grew with the
      growth of industry. They all, therefore, sought for a means to stop the
      development of industry and of the proletariat, to stop the &#8220;wheel of
      history.&#8221;  Marx and Engels did not share the general fear of the
      development of the proletariat; on the contrary, they placed all their
      hopes on its continued growth. The more proletarians there are, the
      greater is their strength as a revolutionary class, and the nearer and
      more possible does socialism become. The services rendered by Marx and
      Engels to the working class may be expressed in a few words thus: they
      taught the working class to know itself and be conscious of itself, and
      they substituted science for dreams.

    <p>
      That<a onmouseover="window.status=' 02 . 020 . v02zz99h . GUESS '" onmouseout="window.status=''"> </a>is why the name and life of Engels should be known to every
      worker. That is why in this collection of articles, the aim of which, as
      of all our publications, is to awaken class-consciousness in the Russian
      workers, we must give a sketch of the life and work of Frederick Engels,
      one of the two great teachers of the modern proletariat.

    <p>
      Engels<a onmouseover="window.status=' 02 . 020 . v02zz99h . GUESS '" onmouseout="window.status=''"> </a>was born in 1820 in Barmen, in the Rhine Province of the
      kingdom of Prussia. His father was a manufacturer. In 1838 Engels, without
      having completed his high-school studies, was forced by family circumstances
      to enter a commercial house in Bremen as a clerk. Commercial affairs did

<!-- vol=02 pg=021 src=v02zz99h type=GUESS --> <a name='v02zz99h:21' /> &nbsp; 

      not prevent Engels from pursuing his scientific and political education.
      He had come to hate autocracy and the tyranny of bureaucrats while still
      at high school. The study of philosophy led him further. At that time
      Hegel&#8217;s teaching dominated German philosophy, and Engels became his
      follower. Although Hegel himself was an admirer of the autocratic Prussian
      state, in whose service he was as a professor at Berlin University,
      Hegel&#8217;s <em>teachings</em> were revolutionary. Hegel&#8217;s faith in human
      reason and its rights, and the fundamental thesis of Hegelian philosophy
      that the universe is undergoing a constant process of change and
      development, led some of the disciples of the Berlin philosopher &#8211; those
      who refused to accept the existing situation &#8211; to the idea that the
      struggle against this situation, the struggle against existing wrong and
      prevalent evil, is also rooted in the universal law of eternal
      development. If all things develop, if institutions of one kind give place
      to others, why should the autocracy of the Prussian king or of the Russian
      tsar, the enrichment of an insignificant minority at the expense of the
      vast majority, or the domination of the bourgeoisie over the people,
      continue for ever? Hegel&#8217;s philosophy spoke of the development of the mind
      and of ideas; it was <em>idealistic.</em> From the development of the mind
      it deduced the development of nature, of man, and of human, social
      relations. While retaining Hegel&#8217;s idea of the eternal process of
      development,<sup><a class="anote"
 id="bkV02P021F01" name="bkV02P021F01"
 href="#fwV02P021F01">[1]</a></sup>

 Marx and Engels rejected the
      preconceived idealist view; turning to life, they saw that it is not the
      development of mind that explains the development of nature but that, on
      the contrary, the explanation of mind must be derived from nature, from
      matter.... Unlike Hegel and the other Hegelians, Marx and Engels were
      materialists. Regarding the world and humanity materialistically, they
      perceived that just as material causes underlie all natural phenomena, so
      the development of human society is conditioned by the development of
      material forces, the productive forces.  On the development of the
      productive forces depend the relations into which

<!-- vol=02 pg=022 src=v02zz99h type=GUESS --> <a name='v02zz99h:22' /> &nbsp; 

      men enter with one another in the production of the things required for
      the satisfaction of human needs. And in these relations lies the
      explanation of all the phenomena of social life, human aspirations, ideas
      and laws.  The development of the productive forces creates social
      relations based upon private property, but now we see that this same
      development of the productive forces deprives the majority of their
      property and concentrates it in the hands of an insignificant minority. It
      abolishes property, the basis of the modern social order, it itself
      strives towards the very aim which the socialists have set themselves. All
      the socialists have to do is to realise which social force, owing to its
      position in modern society, is interested in bringing socialism about, and
      to impart to this force the consciousness of its interests and of its
      historical task. This force is the proletariat. Engels got to know the
      proletariat in England, in the centre of English industry, Manchester,
      where he settled in 1842, entering the service of a commercial firm of
      which his father was a shareholder.  Here Engels not only sat in the
      factory office but wandered about the slums in which the workers were
      cooped up, and saw their poverty and misery with his own eyes. But he did
      not confine himself to personal observations.  He read all that had been
      revealed before him about the condition of the British working class and
      carefully studied all the official documents he could lay his hands
      on. The fruit of these studies and observations was the book which
      appeared in 1845: <em>The Condition of the Working Class in England.</em>
      We have already mentioned what was the chief service rendered by Engels in
      writing <em>The Condition of the Working Class in England.</em> Even
      before Engels, many people had described the sufferings of the proletariat
      and had pointed to the necessity of helping it. Engels was the
      <em>first</em> to say that the proletariat is <em>not only</em> a
      suffering class; that it is, in fact, the disgraceful economic condition
      of the proletariat that drives it irresistibly forward and compels it to
      fight for its ultimate emancipation. And the fighting proletariat <em>will
      help itself.</em> The political movement of the working class will
      inevitably lead the workers to realise that their only salvation lies in
      socialism. On the other hand, socialism will become a force only when it
      becomes the aim of the <em>political</em> struggle

<!-- vol=02 pg=023 src=v02zz99h type=GUESS --> <a name='v02zz99h:23' /> &nbsp; 

      of the working <em>class.</em> Such are the main ideas of Engels&#8217; book on
      the condition of the working class in England, ideas which have now been
      adopted by all thinking and fighting proletarians, but which at that time
      were entirely new. These ideas were set out in a book written in absorbing
      style and filled with most authentic and shocking pictures of the misery
      of the English proletariat. The book was a terrible indictment of
      capitalism and the bourgeoisie and created a profound impression. Engels&#8217;
      book began to be quoted everywhere as presenting the best picture of the
      condition of the modern proletariat. And, in fact, neither before 1845 nor
      after has there appeared so striking and truthful a picture of the misery
      of the working class.

    <p>
      It<a onmouseover="window.status=' 02 . 023 . v02zz99h . GUESS '" onmouseout="window.status=''"> </a>was not until he came to England that Engels became a socialist.  In
      Manchester he established contacts with people active in the English
      labour movement at the time and began to write for English socialist
      publications.  In 1844, while on his way back to Germany, he became
      acquainted in Paris with Marx, with whom he had already started to
      correspond. In Paris, under the influence of the French socialists and
      French life, Marx had also become a socialist. Here the friends jointly
      wrote a book entitled <em>The Holy Family, or Critique of Critical
      Critique.</em> This book, which appeared a year before <em>The Condition
      of the Working Class in England</em>, and the greater part of which was
      written by Marx, contains the foundations of revolutionary materialist
      socialism, the main ideas of which we have expounded above. &#8220;The holy
      family&#8221; is a facetious nickname for the Bauer brothers, the philosophers,
      and their followers. These gentlemen preached a criticism which stood
      above all reality, above parties and politics, which rejected all
      practical activity, and which only &#8220;critically&#8221; contemplated the
      surrounding world and the events going on within it. These gentlemen, the
      Bauers, looked down on the proletariat as an uncritical mass. Marx and
      Engels vigorously opposed this absurd and harmful tendency. In the name of
      a real, human person &#8211; the worker, trampled down by the ruling classes
      and the state &#8211; they demanded, not contemplation, but a struggle for a
      better order of society. They, of course, regarded the proletariat as the
      force that is capable of waging this struggle and that is interested in
      it. Even before

<!-- vol=02 pg=024 src=v02zz99h type=GUESS --> <a name='v02zz99h:24' /> &nbsp; 

      the appearance of <em>The Holy Family</em>, Engels had published in Marx&#8217;s
      and Ruge&#8217;s <em>Deutsch-Franz\"osische

Jahrb\"ucher</em> his &#8220;Critical Essays
      on Political

Economy,&#8221; in which he examined the principal phenomena of the
      contemporary economic order from a socialist standpoint, regarding them as
      necessary consequences of the rule of private property.  Contact with
      Engels was undoubtedly a factor in Marx&#8217;s decision to study political
      economy, the science in which his works have produced a veritable
      revolution.

    <p>
      From<a onmouseover="window.status=' 02 . 024 . v02zz99h . GUESS '" onmouseout="window.status=''"> </a>1845 to 1847 Engels lived in Brussels and Paris, combining scientific
      work with practical activities among the German workers in Brussels and
      Paris. Here Marx and Engels established contact with the secret German
      Communist

League, which commissioned them to expound the main principles
      of the socialism they had worked out. Thus arose the famous <em>Manifesto
      of the Communist Party</em> of Marx and Engels, published in 1848. This
      little booklet is worth whole volumes: to this day its spirit inspires and
      guides the entire organised and fighting proletariat of the civilised
      world.

    </p>
    <p>
      The<a onmouseover="window.status=' 02 . 024 . v02zz99h . GUESS '" onmouseout="window.status=''"> </a>revolution of 1848, which broke out first in France and then spread to
      other West-European countries, brought Marx and Engels back to their
      native country. Here, in Rhenish Prussia, they took charge of the
      democratic <em>Neue Rheinische

Zeitung</em> published in Cologne. The two
      friends were the heart and soul of all revolutionary-democratic
      aspirations in Rhenish Prussia. They fought to the last ditch in defence
      of freedom and of the interests of the people against the forces of
      reaction. The latter, as we know, gained the upper hand. The <em>Neue
      Rheinische Zeitung</em> was suppressed. Marx, who during his exile had
      lost his Prussian citizenship, was deported; Engels took part in the armed
      popular uprising, fought for liberty in three battles, and after the
      defeat of the rebels fled, via Switzerland, to London.

    <p>
      Marx<a onmouseover="window.status=' 02 . 024 . v02zz99h . GUESS '" onmouseout="window.status=''"> </a>also settled in London. Engels soon became a clerk again, and then a
      shareholder, in the Manchester commercial firm in which he had worked in
      the forties. Until 1870 he lived in Manchester, while Marx lived in
      London, but this did not prevent their maintaining a most lively
      interchange of ideas: they corresponded almost daily. In this
      correspondence

<!-- vol=02 pg=025 src=v02zz99h type=GUESS --> <a name='v02zz99h:25' /> &nbsp; 

      the two friends exchanged views and discoveries and continued to
      collaborate in working out scientific socialism. In 1870 Engels moved to
      London, and their joint intellectual life, of the most strenuous nature,
      continued until 1883, when Marx died. Its fruit was, on Marx&#8217;s side,
      <em>Capital</em>, the greatest work on political economy of our age, and
      on Engels&#8217; side, a number of works both large and small. Marx worked on
      the analysis of the complex phenomena of capitalist economy. Engels, in
      simply written works, often of a polemical character, dealt with more
      general scientific problems and with diverse phenomena of the past and
      present in the spirit of the materialist conception of history and Marx&#8217;s
      economic theory. Of Engels&#8217; works we shall mention: the polemical work
      against D\"uhring (analysing highly important problems in the domain of
      philosophy, natural science and the social

sciences),<sup><a class="anote"
 id="bkV02P025F01" name="bkV02P025F01"
 href="#fwV02P025F01">[2]</a></sup>

      <em>The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State</em>
      (translated into Russian, published in St. Petersburg, 3rd ea.,

1895),
      <em>Ludwig Feuerbach</em> (Russian translation and notes by G.  Plekhanov,
      Geneva,

1892), an article on the foreign policy of the Russian Government
      (translated into Russian in the Geneva <em>Social-Demokrat</em>, Nos. 1
      and

2), splendid articles on the housing

question, and finally, two small
      but very valuable articles on Russia&#8217;s economic development <em>(Frederick
      Engels on Russia</em>, translated into Russian by Zasulich, Geneva,

1894).
      Marx died before he could put the final touches to his vast work on
      capital.  The draft, however, was already finished, and after the death of
      his friend, Engels undertook the onerous task of preparing and publishing
      the second and the third volumes of <em>Capital.</em> He published Volume
      II in 1885 and Volume III in 1894 (his death prevented the preparation of

      Volume&#160;IV).  These two volumes entailed a vast amount of labour. Adler,
      the Austrian Social-Democrat, has rightly remarked that by publishing
      volumes II and III of <em>Capital</em> Engels erected a majestic monument
      to the genius who had been his friend, a monument on which, without
      intending it, he indelibly carved his own name. Indeed

<!-- vol=02 pg=026 src=v02zz99h type=GUESS --> <a name='v02zz99h:26' /> &nbsp; 

      these two volumes of <em>Capital</em> are the work of two men: Marx and
      Engels. Old legends contain various moving instances of friendship. The
      European proletariat may say that its science was created by two scholars
      and fighters, whose relationship to each other surpasses the most moving
      stories of the ancients about human friendship.  Engels always &#8211; and, on
      the whole, quite justly &#8211; placed himself after Marx. &#8220;In Marx&#8217;s
      lifetime,&#8221; he wrote to an old friend, &#8220;I played second

fiddle.&#8221; His love
      for the living Marx, and his reverence for the memory of the dead Marx
      were boundless. This stern fighter and austere thinker possessed a deeply
      loving soul.
    </p>

    <p>
      After<a onmouseover="window.status=' 02 . 026 . v02zz99h . GUESS '" onmouseout="window.status=''"> </a>the movement of 1848-49, Marx and Engels in exile did not confine
      themselves to scientific research. In 1864 Marx founded the International
      Working Men&#8217;s

Association, and led this society for a whole decade. Engels
      also took an active part in its affairs. The work of the International
      Association, which, in accordance with Marx&#8217;s idea, united proletarians of
      all countries, was of tremendous significance in the development of the
      working-class movement. But even with the closing down of the
      International Association in the seventies, the unifying role of Marx and
      Engels did not cease. On the contrary, it may be said that their
      importance as the spiritual leaders of the working-class movement grew
      continuously, because the movement itself grew uninterruptedly. After the
      death of Marx, Engels continued alone as the counsellor and leader of the
      European socialists.  His advice and directions were sought for equally by
      the German socialists, whose strength, despite government persecution,
      grew rapidly and steadily, and by representatives of backward countries,
      such as the Spaniards, Rumanians and Russians, who were obliged to ponder
      and weigh their first steps. They all drew on the rich store of knowledge
      and experience of Engels in his old age.

    </p>
    <p>
      Marx<a onmouseover="window.status=' 02 . 026 . v02zz99h . GUESS '" onmouseout="window.status=''"> </a>and Engels, who both knew Russian and read Russian books, took a
      lively interest in the country, followed the Russian revolutionary
      movement with sympathy and maintained contact with Russian
      revolutionaries.  They both became socialists after being
      <em>democrats</em>, and the democratic feeling of <em>hatred</em> for
      political despotism was exceedingly strong in them. This direct political
      feeling, combined

<!-- vol=02 pg=027 src=v02zz99h type=GUESS --> <a name='v02zz99h:27' /> &nbsp; 

      with a profound theoretical understanding of the connection between
      political despotism and economic oppression, and also their rich
      experience of life, made Marx and Engels uncommonly responsive
      <em>politically.</em> That is why the heroic struggle of the handful of
      Russian revolutionaries against the mighty tsarist government evoked a
      most sympathetic echo in the hearts of these tried revolutionaries.  On
      the other hand, the tendency, for the sake of illusory economic
      advantages, to turn away from the most immediate and important task of the
      Russian socialists, namely, the winning of political freedom, naturally
      appeared suspicious to them and was even regarded by them as a direct
      betrayal of the great cause of the social revolution. &#8220;The emancipation of
      the workers must be the act of the working class itself&#8221; &#8211; Marx and
      Engels constantly

taught. But in order to fight for its economic
      emancipation, the proletariat must win itself certain <em>political</em>
      rights. Moreover, Marx and Engels clearly saw that a political revolution
      in Russia would be of tremendous significance to the West-European
      working-class movement as well. Autocratic Russia had always been a
      bulwark of European reaction in general. The extraordinarily favourable
      international position enjoyed by Russia as a result of the war of 1870,
      which for a long time sowed discord between Germany and France, of course
      only enhanced the importance of autocratic Russia as a reactionary
      force. Only a free Russia, a Russia that had no need either to oppress the
      Poles, Finns, Germans, Armenians or any other small nations, or constantly
      to set France and Germany at loggerheads, would enable modern Europe, rid
      of the burden of war, to breathe freely, would weaken all the reactionary
      elements in Europe and strengthen the European working class. That was why
      Engels ardently desired the establishment of political freedom in Russia
      for the sake of the progress of the working-class movement in the West as
      well. In him the Russian revolutionaries have lost their best friend.

      Marx and Engels frequently pointed out that in their intellectual
      development they were much indebted to the great German philosophers,
      particularly to Hegel. &#8220;Without German philosophy,&#8221; Engels says,
      &#8220;scientific socialism would never have come into

being.&#8221;

      This is a wonderfully rich and instructive

book. Unfortunately, only a
      small portion of it, containing a historical outline of the development of
      socialism, has been translated into Russian <em>(The Development of
      Scientific Socialism</em>, 2nd ea., Geneva,

1892).
